<p t="1620" d="6620">After humiliating defeats in Ukraine, Russian
President Vladimir Putin told his people that</p>
<p t="8240" d="4130">the U.S. is bent on destroying the Russian
homeland.</p>
<p t="12370" d="5460">On Wednesday, he drafted 300,000 reservists
and threatened nuclear war.</p>
<p t="17830" d="3300">“This is not a bluff,” he said.</p>
<p t="21130" d="4320">Ukraine dominated this past week’s annual
gathering of the U.N. General Assembly in</p>
<p t="25450" d="5970">New York -- attended by President Biden and
more than 120 world leaders.</p>
<p t="31420" d="6659">Friday, we met the U.S. secretary of state,
Antony Blinken, to talk about a world of challenges</p>
<p t="38079" d="4181">and Putin&#39;s nuclear threat.</p>
<p t="42260" d="10479">Scott Pelley: How concerned should Americans
be about the prospect of nuclear war?</p>
<p t="52739" d="4330">Antony Blinken: Scott we&#39;ve heard a lot of
irresponsible rhetoric coming out of Vladimir</p>
<p t="57069" d="6830">Putin, but we&#39;re focused on making sure that
we&#39;re all acting responsibly, especially when</p>
<p t="63899" d="3041">it comes to this kind of loose rhetoric.</p>
<p t="66940" d="5110">We have-- been very clear with-- the Russians
publicly and-- as well as privately to stop</p>
<p t="72050" d="1980">the loose talk about nuclear weapons.</p>
<p t="74030" d="4690">Scott Pelley: Privately, the United States
has been in communication with the Kremlin</p>
<p t="78720" d="2030">about these threats of nuclear war?</p>
<p t="80750" d="1000">Antony Blinken: Yes.</p>
<p t="81750" d="7400">It&#39;s very important that Moscow hear from
us and know from us that the consequences</p>
<p t="89150" d="2490">would be horrific.</p>
<p t="91640" d="1340">And we&#39;ve made that very clear.</p>
<p t="92980" d="3610">Scott Pelley: You call the nuclear talk &quot;loose
talk.&quot;</p>
<p t="96590" d="5990">But isn&#39;t Vladimir Putin telling us what he&#39;s
going to do if he is backed any further into</p>
<p t="102580" d="1000">a corner?</p>
<p t="103580" d="3430">Antony Blinken: Vladimir Putin has a clear
way out of the war he started and that&#39;s to</p>
<p t="107010" d="1000">end it.</p>
<p t="108010" d="3570">If Russia stops fighting, the war ends.</p>
<p t="111580" d="2400">If Ukraine stops fighting, Ukraine ends.</p>
<p t="113980" d="5230">Scott Pelley: Is there anyone in the Kremlin
who can tell Vladimir Putin “No&quot; if he decides</p>
<p t="119210" d="2190">to launch a battlefield nuclear weapon?</p>
<p t="121400" d="3320">Antony Blinken: They have a chain of command.</p>
<p t="124720" d="4230">Whether it works or not-- to be seen.</p>
<p t="128950" d="4660">But I think what you&#39;re pointing to is a larger
challenge.</p>
<p t="133610" d="5599">And that is the Achilles heel of autocracies
anywhere, there is usually not anyone who</p>
<p t="139209" d="6890">has the capacity or the will to speak truth
to power, And part of the reason I think--</p>
<p t="146099" d="4970">Russia has gotten itself into the mess that
it&#39;s in is because there is no one in the</p>
<p t="151069" d="3451">system to effectively tell Putin he&#39;s doing
the wrong thing.</p>
<p t="154520" d="4630">Scott Pelley: In our interview last week,
President Biden told us that he had a message</p>
<p t="159150" d="3250">for Vladimir Putin on the use of nuclear weapons.</p>
<p t="162400" d="4020">President Joe Biden: Don’t, Don’t, Don’t.</p>
<p t="166420" d="5560">Scott Pelley: He went on to say, the U.S.
response would be consequential.</p>
<p t="171980" d="1649">What did he mean by that?</p>
<p t="173629" d="4351">Antony Blinken: I&#39;m not gonna get into what
the consequences would be- any use of nuclear</p>
<p t="177980" d="6040">weapons would have catastrophic effects for
-- of course the country using them-- but</p>
<p t="184020" d="1000">for many others as well.</p>
<p t="185020" d="3960">Scott Pelley: If you can&#39;t give us specifics
about a U.S. response, can you tell us that</p>
<p t="188980" d="1560">the administration has a plan?</p>
<p t="190540" d="1550">Antony Blinken: We do.</p>
<p t="192090" d="4659">Scott Pelley: Is it a plan that would prevent
World War III?</p>
<p t="196749" d="4671">Antony Blinken: President Biden has been determined
that as we&#39;re doing everything we can to help</p>
<p t="201420" d="4420">the Ukrainians defend themselves, as we&#39;re
doing everything we can to rally other countries</p>
<p t="205840" d="6590">to put pressure on Russia, we&#39;re also determined
that this war not expand, not get broader.</p>
<p t="212430" d="6289">As we were speaking to Secretary Blinken,
news broke that a U.N. investigative commission</p>
<p t="218719" d="6231">had found evidence of rape and torture of
children in Russian-occupied Ukraine.</p>
<p t="224950" d="5890">Scott Pelley: The panel goes on to say, &quot;Based
on the evidence gathered by the commission,</p>
<p t="230840" d="6239">it has concluded that war crimes have been
committed in Ukraine.&quot;</p>
<p t="237079" d="3511">What does justice look like for Ukraine?</p>
<p t="240590" d="7799">Antony Blinken: Justice looks like accountability,
accountability for those who perpetrated these</p>
<p t="248389" d="4841">war crimes, these atrocities, as well as for
those who ordered them.</p>
<p t="253230" d="4700">And it&#39;s one of the reasons, Scott, why--
we&#39;re doing everything we can to support those</p>
<p t="257930" d="2139">who are trying to compile the evidence.</p>
<p t="260069" d="2511">And to investigate.</p>
<p t="262580" d="2040">And ultimately, to prosecute those responsible.</p>
<p t="264620" d="1180">Scott Pelley: To prosecute?</p>
<p t="265800" d="1560">You believe there should be war crime trials?</p>
<p t="267360" d="2550">Antony Blinken: I was in Ukraine a couple
of weeks ago.</p>
<p t="269910" d="5729">One of the places I visited was a city called
Irpin, And I saw residential buildings, building</p>
<p t="275639" d="5611">block after building block, totally bombed
out this was the totally indiscriminate use</p>
<p t="281250" d="1710">of force.</p>
<p t="282960" d="5299">wherever the Russian tide recedes, what&#39;s
left in its wake is very clear evidence of</p>
<p t="288259" d="4641">atrocities and war crimes.</p>
<p t="292900" d="5811">Atrocities were laid before the U.N Security
Council last Thursday, drawing from the Russian</p>
<p t="298711" d="2708">foreign minister a dubious defense.</p>
<p t="301419" d="6941">Scott Pelley: When Sergey Lavrov says that,
the atrocities have been staged and it is</p>
<p t="308360" d="5480">Russia that is the victim, Tony Blinken is
sitting there thinking what?</p>
<p t="313840" d="2079">Antony Blinken: This is “Alice in Wonderland.”</p>
<p t="315919" d="1851">It&#39;s the world upside down.</p>
<p t="317770" d="4540">Up is down, white is black-- truth is false.</p>
<p t="322310" d="3400">But here&#39;s the thing, Scott.</p>
<p t="325710" d="6769">All of these words, all of these words ring
totally hollow to every member on the Security</p>
<p t="332479" d="1000">Council.</p>
<p t="333479" d="6370">So this spewing of words-- is not having an
effect.</p>
<p t="339849" d="6681">On the contrary, I think it just shows the
total disconnect between Russia and virtually</p>
<p t="346530" d="2349">the entirety of the rest of the world.</p>
<p t="348879" d="6421">At the moment we spoke to the secretary, Russia
was hurrying through what it calls “elections”</p>
<p t="355300" d="6260">to force these areas of Ukraine&#39;s occupied
east and south into the Russian Federation.</p>
<p t="361560" d="4650">Antony Blinken: These so-called elections
are a sham, period.</p>
<p t="366210" d="1179">They go in.</p>
<p t="367389" d="3141">They put in puppet governments, local governments.</p>
<p t="370530" d="6409">And then they proceed with a vote, which they&#39;ll
manipulate in any event in order to try to</p>
<p t="376939" d="3271">declare the territory Russian territory.</p>
<p t="380210" d="1370">It is not.</p>
<p t="381580" d="1910">It will never be recognized as such.</p>
<p t="383490" d="4160">And the Ukrainians have every right to take
it back.</p>
<p t="387650" d="4949">Blinken came to our interview after meeting
China&#39;s foreign minister.</p>
<p t="392599" d="5711">China has been raising pressure on the democratic
island of Taiwan which, in our conversation</p>
<p t="398310" d="4389">last week, President Biden pledged to defend
with force.</p>
<p t="402699" d="6240">Scott Pelley: So unlike Ukraine, to be clear,
sir, U.S. Forces, U.S. men and women would</p>
<p t="408939" d="3141">defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion?</p>
<p t="412080" d="1970">President Joe Biden: Yes.</p>
<p t="414050" d="6750">But official U.S. policy is, and has been
for decades, to remain ambiguous about defending</p>
<p t="420800" d="1000">the island.</p>
<p t="421800" d="3889">Antony Blinken: China has acted increasingly
aggressively when it comes to Taiwan.</p>
<p t="425689" d="3081">That poses a threat to peace and stability
in the entire region.</p>
<p t="428770" d="4359">Scott Pelley: The Chinese foreign minister
must have asked you to explain the President&#39;s</p>
<p t="433129" d="1000">remarks.</p>
<p t="434129" d="6690">Antony Blinken: Well, we had a conversation
about our different approaches-- to Taiwan,</p>
<p t="440819" d="5900">and I reiterated what-- what the President
has said, and what he&#39;s said clearly and consistently.</p>
<p t="446719" d="7630">Our continued adherence to the-- the One China
Policy-- our determination that-- the differences</p>
<p t="454349" d="7380">be resolved peacefully-- our insistence--
that peace and stability be maintained in</p>
<p t="461729" d="5650">the Taiwan Straits, and our deep concern that
China was taking actions to try to change</p>
<p t="467379" d="1151">that status quo.</p>
<p t="468530" d="1449">That&#39;s what the issue is.</p>
<p t="469979" d="5210">Blinken warns that turbulence in the Taiwan
Strait would wash around the world.</p>
<p t="475189" d="7130">Antony Blinken: Taiwan itself, were anything
to happen, it is where virtually all the semiconductors--</p>
<p t="482319" d="2130">are-- are made.</p>
<p t="484449" d="4710">One of the-- one of the reasons we&#39;re now
investing so heavily in our own capacity to</p>
<p t="489159" d="2100">produce semiconductors here in the United
States.</p>
<p t="491259" d="5331">We designed them, but the actual production
is done in a handful of places, and Taiwan</p>
<p t="496590" d="3169">produces most of them if that’s disrupted
the effects that that would have on the global</p>
<p t="499759" d="2271">economy could be devastating.</p>
<p t="502030" d="6219">Last week on 60 Minutes, the president of
Iran told Lesley Stahl he would consider re-entering</p>
<p t="508249" d="3821">the deal to restrict Iran&#39;s nuclear weapons
program.</p>
<p t="512070" d="2589">The Trump administration had canceled it.</p>
<p t="514659" d="2440">Blinken doubts that Iran is serious.</p>
<p t="517099" d="7461">Antony Blinken: Iran has continued to try
to add extraneous issues to the negotiation</p>
<p t="524560" d="3070">that we&#39;re simply not going to say yes to.</p>
<p t="527630" d="5199">We will not accept a bad deal, the response
that they&#39;ve given to the last proposals put</p>
<p t="532829" d="5380">forward by our European partners have been
a very significant step backwards.</p>
<p t="538209" d="5620">And so, I don&#39;t see any prospects in the very
near term to-- to bring this to a conclusion.</p>
<p t="543829" d="2010">Antony Blinken is 60.</p>
<p t="545839" d="5930">One of his grandparents was born in Ukraine,
his stepfather survived the Holocaust.</p>
<p t="551769" d="2940">And his father was a U.S. ambassador.</p>
<p t="554709" d="5581">Blinken has spent 30 years in foreign policy
for Democrats mostly in the Senate and the</p>
<p t="560290" d="1000">White House.</p>
<p t="561290" d="5479">He was in the back of the room during the
strike on Osama Bin Laden.</p>
<p t="566769" d="8081">His philosophy on American diplomacy is robust
engagement with what he calls, humility and</p>
<p t="574850" d="1000">confidence.</p>
<p t="575850" d="5210">Antony Blinken: If we don&#39;t engage, if we&#39;re
not leading, then one of two things, either</p>
<p t="581060" d="5020">someone else is and probably not in a way
that&#39;s gonna advance our interests and values,</p>
<p t="586080" d="2860">or no one is, and then you tend to have chaos.</p>
<p t="588940" d="3410">You get a vacuum that&#39;s filled by bad things
before it&#39;s filled with good things.</p>
<p t="592350" d="2560">Because the world does not organize itself.</p>
<p t="594910" d="5640">There&#39;s not a single big problem that&#39;s affecting
the lives of our citizens that we can effectively</p>
<p t="600550" d="1480">solve alone.</p>
<p t="602030" d="4390">Whether it&#39;s climate, whether it&#39;s COVID,
whether it&#39;s the effect of all of these emerging</p>
<p t="606420" d="5560">technologies on our lives, we have to be working
with others to try to shape all of this in</p>
<p t="611980" d="4549">a way that&#39;s actually gonna make our people,
as well as other people, a little bit more</p>
<p t="616529" d="3131">secure, a little bit more prosperous, a little
bit more full of opportunity.</p>
<p t="619660" d="7710">Scott Pelley: Given January 6th, given the
fabricated controversy over the election results,</p>
<p t="627370" d="6279">do you find that countries around the world
are worried about the stability of the United</p>
<p t="633649" d="1000">States?</p>
<p t="634649" d="5740">Antony Blinken: It&#39;s no secret that we have
challenges within our own democracy.</p>
<p t="640389" d="2421">They&#39;re playing out before the entire world.</p>
<p t="642810" d="3820">We don&#39;t sweep them under the rug, even when
it&#39;s painful.</p>
<p t="646630" d="6190">So I&#39;m able to say to other countries that
bring these up, yes, we&#39;ve got our problems,</p>
<p t="652820" d="1389">but we&#39;re confronting them.</p>
<p t="654209" d="1321">We&#39;re dealing with them.</p>
<p t="655530" d="1480">You might do the same thing.</p>
<p t="657010" d="4970">Scott Pelley: Your father was U.S. ambassador
to Hungary.</p>
<p t="661980" d="5060">And as we sit here on Friday afternoon, he
passed away last night.</p>
<p t="667040" d="8159">And I wonder why you decided to keep such
a busy schedule the day after that tragedy</p>
<p t="675199" d="1151">in your family.</p>
<p t="676350" d="5960">Antony Blinken: My dad was 96 years old.</p>
<p t="682310" d="6940">He was in so many ways my role model. he built
a remarkable business, one of the leading</p>
<p t="689250" d="7639">investment banks in this country over many
years, He led a life of dignity, of decency,</p>
<p t="696889" d="4221">of modesty that is something I&#39;ve very much
aspired to.</p>
<p t="701110" d="6810">And so I-- I guess I thought that -- honoring
everything that he shared with me, the best</p>
<p t="707920" d="3760">way to do that was to continue doing my job.</p>
<p t="711680" d="6180">That job, for the foreseeable future, will
be consumed with a question that has defeated</p>
<p t="717860" d="6260">generations of diplomats—how to keep a small
war in Europe from igniting the world.</p>
<p t="724120" d="3980">Scott Pelley: Are there any talks currently
that we may not have heard about?</p>
<p t="728100" d="3909">Antony Blinken: There are no talks because
Russia has not demonstrated any willingness</p>
<p t="732009" d="3881">in this moment to engage in meaningful discussions.</p>
<p t="735890" d="4770">If and when that changes, we will do everything
we can to support a diplomatic process.</p>
<p t="740660" d="2190">Scott Pelley: Is Vladimir Putin losing this
war?</p>
<p t="742850" d="3549">Antony Blinken: He&#39;s already lost in terms
of what he was trying to achieve.</p>
<p t="746399" d="6451">Because keep in mind, what he said very clearly
from the start is, his objective was to erase</p>
<p t="752850" d="5200">Ukraine&#39;s identity as an independent country,
that has already failed.</p>
<p t="758050" d="1729">Ukrainians are fighting for their own land.</p>
<p t="759779" d="1831">They&#39;re fighting for their own country.</p>
<p t="761610" d="1960">The Russians are not.</p>
<p t="763570" d="4870">And these Russian soldiers who are being thrown
into this conflict, often not knowing where</p>
<p t="768440" d="4690">they&#39;re going or what they&#39;re doing-- this
is not something that they want to be fighting</p>
<p t="773130" d="1190">for.</p>
<p t="774320" d="3250">The Ukrainians are fighting for their own
future.</p>
<p t="777570" d="1920">They&#39;re fighting for their own land.</p>
<p t="779490" d="1070">They&#39;re fighting for their own lives.</p>
