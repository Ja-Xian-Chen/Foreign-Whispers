be dark in here you can&#39;t switch the lights on  </p>
<p t="103520" d="6880">because a bomb could just fly in during an 
airstrike you have you have troops sleeping  </p>
<p t="110400" d="9120">the president and his staff have lived here for 
46 days now russian invasion plan expected kiev  </p>
<p t="119520" d="7440">to fall in three days but that relied on 
one assumption that zielinski would run no</p>
<p t="134240" d="5440">before i do something i analyze the situation 
i&#39;ve always done it calmly without any chaos  </p>
<p t="140880" d="5040">i might not be the strongest warrior 
but i&#39;m not willing to betray anyone  </p>
<p t="146880" d="3360">what did you tell your wife and

<p t="160240" d="5920">i&#39;m the president of our people and even if 
i wasn&#39;t president i would have stayed here  </p>
<p t="167840" d="6640">my family understood not only understood

<p t="190240" d="7600">we are all here protecting our independence 
our country and we&#39;re going to continue  </p>
<p t="198800" d="4240">you had made a decision to give your 
life for your country if it came to that  </p>
<p t="207440" d="5520">i don&#39;t want to make myself out to be 
a hero he said i love my family i want  </p>
<p t="212960" d="5760">to live many more years but choosing 
between running or being with my people  </p>
<p t="219600" d="6160">of course i&#39;m ready to give my life for my 
country you just want to work for a man with  </p>
<p t="225760" d="8320">44 million lives in his hands we found zielinski 
buoyant gracious humble and brutally honest</p>
<p t="237600" d="3440">the day before our visit and angrier zielinski  </p>
<p t="241040" d="4960">scolded the u.n security council 
where&#39;s the security he asked</p>
<p t="248880" d="2320">in speaking to nato you called them weak  </p>
<p t="251920" d="4240">in speaking to the u.n security 
council you said if you can&#39;t help  </p>
<p t="256160" d="9200">you shouldn&#39;t exist not very diplomatic of you i 
wonder why you feel the need to speak so bluntly</p>
<p t="268960" d="7280">when you&#39;re working at diplomacy there are no 
results all of this is very bureaucratic that&#39;s  </p>
<p t="276240" d="8240">why the way i am talking to them is absolutely 
justifiable i don&#39;t have any more lives to give  </p>
<p t="284480" d="6640">i don&#39;t have any more emotions i&#39;m no longer 
interested in their diplomacy that leads to  </p>
<p t="291120" d="6960">the destruction of my country a lot of countries 
have changed their mind about ukraine and about  </p>
<p t="298080" d="7360">our people but i think we&#39;ve paid too high a 
price for that what must the world understand</p>
<p t="307920" d="7360">we are defending the ability of a person to 
live in the modern world we are defending  </p>
<p t="315280" d="7760">the right to live bravo i never thought this 
right was so costly these are human values  </p>
<p t="323040" d="5840">so that russia doesn&#39;t choose what we 
should do and how i&#39;m exercising my rights  </p>
<p t="329760" d="4160">that right was given to me by god and my parents</p>
<p t="336080" d="5600">god was hard to find on our 
visit to keeve&#39;s northern suburbs  </p>
<p t="341680" d="5920">which russia occupied for weeks much of 
what we found will be difficult to watch  </p>
<p t="348720" d="7440">behind saint andrews church there is a sandy 
trench not quite full of civilian residents of the  </p>
<p t="356160" d="7840">town of bucha ukraine stopped the russians here 
45 minutes from the center of the capital city  </p>
<p t="364800" d="7920">the russian retreat was so hasty it seems there 
was no time to cover up the war crimes president  </p>
<p t="372720" d="9520">zielinski visited bucha two days before our 
interview what did you see in bucha smart death  </p>
<p t="384080" d="7920">just death last monday was the first 
time zielinski saw with his own eyes  </p>
<p t="392000" d="6080">what russia has done in what vladimir 
putin calls the liberation of ukraine</p>
<p t="400240" d="8800">the day after our interview we found civilian 
neighborhoods in bucha blocks and blocks shelled  </p>
<p t="409040" d="9200">and blasted with no purpose but terror bodies 
and parts of bodies lay in the streets left out  </p>
<p t="418240" d="8240">like trash zielinski told us no one knows how many 
victims are still in their homes yet to be found  </p>
<p t="428000" d="3120">there&#39;s a photograph mr president of you in bucha  </p>
<p t="431840" d="4960">with an expression on your face that you have 
not allowed your people to see during this war  </p>
<p t="437440" d="7680">and i wonder what we&#39;re seeing there is that 
heartbreak is it anger this is least it&#39;s anger</p>
<p t="447200" d="2640">it&#39;s anger</p>
<p t="452480" d="4080">because we don&#39;t understand 
the russians you can&#39;t really  </p>
<p t="456560" d="7280">understand this world that there are 
people on this planet who give these orders</p>
<p t="469040" d="2960">neighborhood relief for 
the hungry and the homeless  </p>
<p t="472560" d="7200">looked like world war ii in color valerie 
met vienko was so angry about the senseless  </p>
<p t="479760" d="5600">russian bullet wound in his leg we 
can&#39;t repeat what he told us in english</p>
<p t="487520" d="5840">some of the russians were normal some of them 
were totally crazy you could walk and they  </p>
<p t="493360" d="5520">would shoot sometimes up in the air sometimes at 
your legs so you&#39;d have to jump in front of them  </p>
<p t="499840" d="4320">cars were run over by russian tanks very brutal</p>
<p t="510880" d="8960">who compressed the occupation 
into a single word horror</p>
<p t="520640" d="8240">she said gunfire was nonstop day and night thanks 
to god it all passed and we survived it&#39;s simply a  </p>
<p t="528880" d="6880">miracle i had two grandchildren with me in the 
basement i never thought i would live to see  </p>
<p t="536480" d="8320">this horror mr zielinski told us that he 
couldn&#39;t believe that human beings could do  </p>
<p t="544800" d="6560">something like this we never believed it 
either we are simply in shock all of us  </p>
<p t="552080" d="4080">what evidence is there of 
war crimes across ukraine</p>
<p t="559200" d="4480">the ukrainian security service has 
intercepted communications he told us  </p>
<p t="564320" d="4640">there are russian soldiers talking with 
their parents about what they stole and  </p>
<p t="568960" d="5680">who they abducted there are recordings of 
russian prisoners of war who admitted to  </p>
<p t="574640" d="7680">killing people there are pilots in prison 
who had maps with civilian targets to bomb  </p>
<p t="583680" d="6400">there are also investigations being done based on 
the remains of the dead should vladimir putin be  </p>
<p t="590080" d="7440">prosecuted for war crimes they would say look i 
i think everyone who made a decision who issued  </p>
<p t="597520" d="7600">an order who fulfilled an order everyone who is 
relevant to this i believe they are all guilty  </p>
<p t="606800" d="7280">do you hold putin responsible i do believe 
he&#39;s one of them that&#39;s what i believe</p>
<p t="616480" d="6480">the slaughter of civilians could have been stopped 
zielinski told us he&#39;s deeply grateful for the  </p>
<p t="622960" d="6400">weapons nato and the u.s are sending around the 
clock but he&#39;s bitterly disappointed the allies  </p>
<p t="629360" d="7120">refused to impose a no-fly zone over ukraine 
president biden has called that an invitation to  </p>
<p t="636480" d="9440">world war three but in zielinski&#39;s view it&#39;s the 
kind of inaction the world has suffered before mr  </p>
<p t="645920" d="9840">president in a speech to nato you said quote all 
the people who die will die because of you because  </p>
<p t="655760" d="7440">of your weakness are you saying that the west 
bears some responsibility for these atrocities  </p>
<p t="664880" d="6240">he told us i remember all of us remember 
books about the second world war and about  </p>
<p t="671120" d="7760">the devil in uniform adolf hitler are those 
countries who did not participate in the war  </p>
<p t="678880" d="6240">responsible the countries who let german 
forces march throughout europe does the world  </p>
<p t="685120" d="8240">carry responsibility for the genocide yes yes it 
does when you have the ability to close the sky</p>
<p t="695760" d="4880">yes it&#39;s scary that a world war could 
start it&#39;s scary i understand that  </p>
<p t="701200" d="4240">and i cannot put pressure on these 
people because everyone is afraid  </p>
<p t="705440" d="9920">of war but whether the world is responsible 
for this i believe so yes i believe so stand  </p>
<p t="715360" d="6560">in front of the mirror every day and ask yourself 
were you able to do something or were you  </p>
<p t="721920" d="7040">unable to do something you will find the answer 
in the mirror to this question and to another</p>
<p t="732480" d="6640">that&#39;s what i believe perhaps zelinski reaches 
for world war ii because of his homeland&#39;s history  </p>
<p t="739120" d="8320">of catastrophe and because he&#39;s ukraine&#39;s first 
jewish president zielinski is 44 years old holds a  </p>
<p t="747440" d="7680">law degree he&#39;s married with a son and a daughter 
his family is safe somewhere in ukraine in this  </p>
<p t="755120" d="8000">war zielinski is the leading man in a tragedy but 
he&#39;s worked his entire career to make people laugh  </p>
<p t="763760" d="5760">he was ukraine&#39;s favorite comedian 
whose sitcom was popular in russia too  </p>
<p t="771440" d="6880">in his show called servant of the people he 
played a high school history teacher whose anger  </p>
<p t="778320" d="4080">at corruption in ukraine explodes into a profane</p>
<p t="785600" d="8080">a rant posts the tirade and the teacher is 
elected president in 2019 zielinski turned  </p>
<p t="793680" d="7920">parody into power he ran on an anti-corruption 
platform and won 73 percent of the vote  </p>
<p t="802240" d="6800">he was 41 years old he brought long-time 
friend and business partner andre your mac in  </p>
<p t="809040" d="10400">as chief of staff he is a smart he&#39;s a strong 
he&#39;s a brave and he&#39;s person who is self-made  </p>
<p t="819440" d="7360">zielinski is not just the leader of our heroic 
nation i think he is a leader of the free world  </p>
<p t="827440" d="7040">why do you say president zielinski is the leader 
of the free world now because ukraine defend not  </p>
<p t="835120" d="9040">just ukraine we defend all democracy zielinski has 
been defending ukraine since his inauguration day  </p>
<p t="844160" d="6560">that green t-shirt which caught the eye of the 
world was no surprise to ukrainians he keeps  </p>
<p t="850720" d="6480">fatigues in his office because he often visited 
the battlefront near the russian border where  </p>
<p t="857200" d="7680">ukraine has been in a shooting war with russia 
since 2014. that was when putin invaded part of  </p>
<p t="864880" d="8240">ukraine called the donbas and seized ukraine&#39;s 
crimea peninsula in 2014 before zielinski was  </p>
<p t="873120" d="10000">elected a russian anti-aircraft battery in ukraine 
shot down an airliner killing 298 civilians</p>
<p t="885360" d="6800">in our interview zielinski told us he&#39;s been 
trying to warn the world that putin will not  </p>
<p t="892160" d="6240">stop at ukraine mr president it appears that 
the free world has calculated that the suffering  </p>
<p t="898400" d="9200">of your people is not worth even the risk of a 
nuclear exchange yet i think so that&#39;s how it is  </p>
<p t="909040" d="6160">some are using that politically as an excuse 
by saying we can&#39;t defend ukraine because there  </p>
<p t="915200" d="7120">could be a nuclear war i think that today no one 
in this world can predict what russia will do  </p>
<p t="923200" d="5760">if they invade further into our territory they 
will definitely move closer and closer to europe  </p>
<p t="929680" d="5680">they will only become stronger and less 
predictable president biden says he is  </p>
<p t="935360" d="9120">outraged by bucha nato leaders say they are 
outraged by bucha so what should they do now</p>
<p t="946880" d="6560">weapons number one they need to be very serious 
about it they definitely understand what i&#39;m  </p>
<p t="953440" d="6000">talking about right now they have to supply 
weapons to ukraine as if they were defending  </p>
<p t="959440" d="6560">themselves and their own people they need 
to understand this if they don&#39;t speed up  </p>
<p t="966640" d="3280">it will be very hard for us to 
hold on against this pressure  </p>
<p t="971200" d="5520">the second factor is sanctions because we&#39;ve 
found some things in sanctions that are easy  </p>
<p t="976720" d="6640">for financial experts to circumvent russia has 
been circumventing them and this is absolutely  </p>
<p t="983360" d="8800">true the western world knows it this shouldn&#39;t 
be allowed this is not a movie this is real life  </p>
<p t="992880" d="9200">stop fearing the russian federation we&#39;ve shown 
we are not afraid when we come back in the wake  </p>
<p t="1002080" d="7760">of the bucha atrocities president zielinski tells 
the united states what he must have to survive</p>
<p t="1018080" d="6720">friday a russian missile strike hit a crowd 
of refugees striving to escape eastern ukraine  </p>
<p t="1024800" d="8240">by train at least 50 were killed five children 
ukrainian president volodimer zelinski calls it a  </p>
<p t="1033040" d="6400">war crime tonight zielinski is fighting a powerful 
russian assault on ukraine&#39;s east and south  </p>
<p t="1040000" d="6560">russia has not seized its strategic objectives 
so instead it&#39;s shelling defiant cities  </p>
<p t="1046560" d="8720">to ruin the one exception at least now is kiev 
in a feat of arms no one expected ukraine&#39;s  </p>
<p t="1055280" d="6800">outgunned army defeated the massive russian force 
that had been ordered to take the capital city  </p>
<p t="1063920" d="1920">the story will continue in a moment</p>
<p t="1072080" d="8160">keeves survives for the moment a capital of 
mummified monuments and 19th century grace  </p>
<p t="1080240" d="6480">before it was a bumper-to-bumper city 
with 3 million residents but now the  </p>
<p t="1086720" d="7280">streets are congested only by shadows air 
raids are still a danger but after nearly  </p>
<p t="1094000" d="7920">seven weeks the siren doesn&#39;t quicken the step 
like it used to have you won the battle of kiev</p>
<p t="1104720" d="3120">give</p>
<p t="1129440" d="6800">if the people of those towns were wiped out 
then did we win this battle i&#39;m not sure  </p>
<p t="1136240" d="7200">we&#39;ve withstood and we did not give up 
what is ours but whether we won i can&#39;t say</p>
<p t="1147200" d="7200">no one expected ukraine to fight russia to 
a standstill and i wonder how did you manage</p>
<p t="1156880" d="7200">we united as a nation even though our people 
understood that they would be outnumbered tenfold  </p>
<p t="1164080" d="7120">and there would be no way out just no way out 
we fought for our existence and for survival</p>
<p t="1174160" d="6720">that&#39;s the combined heroism of everyone of the 
people of the authorities of the armed forces  </p>
<p t="1181440" d="2720">we became a single fist</p>
<p t="1187360" d="6880">we saw the ukrainian punch in the town of bucha 
where the remains of a russian armored column  </p>
<p t="1194240" d="7840">rested dead in the street neighbors holed up for 
weeks emerged to remember what victory looks like  </p>
<p t="1202880" d="5040">no one seemed in a hurry to deal with the 
bits of russian soldiers in the wreckage  </p>
<p t="1209040" d="7120">the full story of how the outmanned ukrainian army 
stopped the invasion of kiev will fill history  </p>
<p t="1216160" d="7120">books but we already know part of it because the 
russians believe that keeve would fall in a matter  </p>
<p t="1223280" d="7120">of days they literally did not bring enough food 
or fuel for their armored columns on the other  </p>
<p t="1230400" d="7360">side the ukrainians have been trained for years by 
the california national guard and other u.s units  </p>
<p t="1238480" d="4800">when the invasion happened the united 
states britain and other countries  </p>
<p t="1243280" d="7520">flooded ukraine with lightweight shoulder-fired 
anti-tank missiles how much difference have  </p>
<p t="1250800" d="8320">american arms made in this war they&#39;re helping 
frankly speaking i would have wanted more i don&#39;t  </p>
<p t="1259120" d="6400">know if i have the right to say that but the fact 
that the united states has helped a lot is true  </p>
<p t="1266640" d="6960">zielinski&#39;s man in charge of arming ukraine 
is chief of staff andre yermack when we met  </p>
<p t="1273600" d="5520">he just finished a two-hour call with u.s 
national security adviser jake sullivan  </p>
<p t="1279120" d="6960">and the chairman of the joint chiefs general mark 
milley yermak asked for heavier weapons faster  </p>
<p t="1286800" d="7440">first there was artillery the second we need 
the tanks we need the military jets and we need  </p>
<p t="1294240" d="6880">everything which give to us opportunity to close 
our sky when you ask the biden administration  </p>
<p t="1301120" d="6640">for artillery tanks jet airplanes the 
administration says what we have very deep  </p>
<p t="1308640" d="7680">and very detailed conversation this is american 
presidents who is done for ukraine more than all  </p>
<p t="1316320" d="6640">other presidents but then you have the 
war and we are openly said we need more  </p>
<p t="1323840" d="9440">it&#39;s not enough we need it as soon as possible 
if we receive this support in time we will win  </p>
<p t="1334800" d="7200">a white house official tells us yermak got a yes 
to his requests but filling orders takes time  </p>
<p t="1342720" d="6800">the ukrainians need russian-made weapons that 
they already know how to use the u.s is cajoling  </p>
<p t="1349520" d="6320">allies to ship their russian gear now on the 
promise that the u.s will replace it later  </p>
<p t="1356800" d="6640">america has thrown in nearly 2 billion 
in military aid from the ukrainian point  </p>
<p t="1363440" d="6320">of view of course nothing is fast enough 
russian bombardment is escalating in the east  </p>

will be but we understand they&#39;ll be many times  </p>
<p t="1393520" d="8320">more than there is now all depends on how

<p t="1422320" d="6880">to tell you the truth long ago i asked president 
biden for very specific items he has the list  </p>
<p t="1429200" d="7200">president president biden can enter history as 
the person who stood shoulder to shoulder with  </p>
<p t="1436400" d="8560">the ukrainian people who won and chose the right 
to have their own country this also depends on him</p>
<p t="1447680" d="5520">you are frustrated with president 
biden no i&#39;m not disappointed  </p>
<p t="1454880" d="5040">i don&#39;t know how another president in his 
place would help us i don&#39;t know it&#39;s difficult  </p>
<p t="1461280" d="6320">we have a good relationship i think so 
at least ukraine depends on the support  </p>
<p t="1467600" d="6240">of the united states and i as the leader 
of a country at war i can only be grateful</p>
<p t="1476640" d="6560">as for the other president at war we asked 
zelinski if he would meet now face to face  </p>
<p t="1483200" d="6560">with vladimir putin he told us it was worth the 
chance they wouldn&#39;t resolve everything zelinski  </p>
<p t="1489760" d="10080">said but they might stop the killing are you 
willing to give up any part of ukraine for peace</p>

questions like this will be raised in negotiations  </p>
<p t="1543520" d="6080">if there ever are any but we were not ready 
to give up our territory from the beginning  </p>
