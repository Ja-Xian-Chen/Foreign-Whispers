made of barbed wire that&#39;s exactly how china is  </p>
<p t="117520" d="8400">going to use olympics not as a celebration for 
humanity but actually use it as a platform to  </p>
<p t="125920" d="5920">promoting its propaganda which is fundamentally 
cracking down on people&#39;s basic rights  </p>

my social media twitter instagram direct message  </p>
<p t="188320" d="7120">bariata knows that as an artist poking the chinese 
regime he risks retaliation both against himself  </p>
<p t="195440" d="5520">and his family back in china for years 
he hid behind a mask in public working  </p>
<p t="200960" d="6560">incognito guerrilla style both in australia 
and any time he traveled he adopted a pseudonym  </p>
<p t="207520" d="6560">bariata a name that purposely he says has no 
meaning how many people know your real name  </p>
<p t="214080" d="5440">if you know i&#39;m bariotal then you don&#39;t know my 
real name and if you know my real name then you  </p>

the relationship between your popularity and  </p>
<p t="258000" d="7040">your security i do think it has a very close 
relationship so almost the more popular you get  </p>
<p t="265040" d="5600">you&#39;re buying yourself an extra layer of security 
yeah and that&#39;s the only way that you can do it  </p>
<p t="271760" d="7200">maybe so but being popular also means his work has 
been scrubbed by sensors inside china what is it  </p>
<p t="278960" d="7680">about your work that drives this regime crazy i 
guess it&#39;s this attitude that i don&#39;t care about  </p>
<p t="286640" d="4080">how serious you are how dangerous 
you are i&#39;m just gonna be myself  </p>
<p t="291440" d="6880">i am an individual i&#39;m not controlled by any 
authority certainly not ccp that scares them  </p>

in internet memes surfaced comparing xi jinping  </p>
<p t="318240" d="6320">and barack obama to winnie the pooh and tigger

was irresistible he created a series of cartoons  </p>
<p t="332080" d="6080">poking fun at shi&#39;s hard-line stance against an 
animated disney character what was it about winnie  </p>
<p t="338160" d="6480">the pooh why was that so effective because winnie 
pooh is so loved by public it&#39;s so recognized  </p>
<p t="345600" d="5600">and when it&#39;s combined with xi jinping&#39;s image 
then you have people ask questions why do you  </p>
<p t="351200" d="5920">want to delete that yellow bear you recognize 
the absurdity of this towering superpower being  </p>
<p t="357120" d="8800">so offended by a benign yellow bear exactly if you 
were in the democratic society i think politicians  </p>
<p t="365920" d="6960">will be thrilled if they can compare with winnie 
the pooh instead of some evil character but we&#39;re  </p>

<p t="387760" d="6480">bhadiatsao posted this tongue-in-cheek creation 
online he called she forever when the communist  </p>
<p t="394240" d="5760">party went to work on passing a resolution 
favorably equating she to the dictator mao zedong  </p>
<p t="400640" d="6560">variation armed with posters homemade glue and a 
full satchel of outrage went to work in manhattan  </p>
<p t="407760" d="6480">he compared xi to a magician conjuring chairman 
mao&#39;s spirit xi jinping has tried to portray  </p>
<p t="414240" d="6640">himself as another malta another red son of 
china he won&#39;t achieve what mao has achieved  </p>
<p t="420880" d="8160">he won&#39;t be celebrated as this god-like figure 
like mao enjoyed in his time it was by accident  </p>

<p t="473680" d="6240">dissident who made this happen your parents 
hadn&#39;t told you about this never teachers never</p>
<p t="482160" d="4400">discovering the truth about tiananmen 
square made baditsau want to leave china</p>
<p t="489760" d="4240">it wasn&#39;t just what had happened it 
was how easily the history was erased  </p>
<p t="494640" d="7520">in 2009 he resettled to australia gave up law 
and started drawing despite no formal training he  </p>
<p t="502160" d="4960">eventually branched out traveling and performing

stood in front of the chinese military in 1989.  </p>
<p t="528640" d="8400">tank man is the ghost hunting ccp the most what 
does tankman represent it shows that any ordinary  </p>
<p t="537040" d="9040">people or person could have the courage to stand 
in front of the most powerful object i know the  </p>
<p t="546080" d="7280">image of tank man is always near you before the 
25th anniversary of tandem massacre i just want  </p>
<p t="553360" d="6640">something on my right arm the arm that i used to 
draw as a reminder that this ordinary chinese guy  </p>
<p t="561200" d="5440">who just collect all the courage in the 
world and push himself in front of the tank  </p>
<p t="567760" d="5680">he&#39;s fearless while in the u.s bodyatsau 
connected with students who marched for  </p>
<p t="573440" d="5840">democracy in tiananmen square they&#39;re now 
middle aged exiled and still bare scars  </p>

<p t="602960" d="5120">and he&#39;s so creative that&#39;s how you feel he&#39;s 
he&#39;s carrying the torch for what your generation  </p>
<p t="608080" d="7280">started yes definitely as a protest leader 
joe became the fifth most wanted man in china  </p>
<p t="615360" d="6400">he spent a year in jail then fled to the u.s in 
the mid-90s joe says china doesn&#39;t know how to  </p>
<p t="621760" d="7440">handle bhadiatsau chinese influence over the world 
is so pervasive and they can control anything for  </p>
<p t="629200" d="7120">example you know u.s companies but still they 
cannot change value utah this one single person  </p>
<p t="636320" d="7760">who can always come out with endless arts 
challenging the authority you think the  </p>
<p t="644080" d="6080">chinese communist party can pressure companies 
and other nations yeah but they can&#39;t they can&#39;t  </p>
<p t="650160" d="6000">change this perspective yeah that&#39;s the spirit 
of tenkamen the person versus this totalitarian  </p>
<p t="656160" d="7360">nation it&#39;s definitely a thong in their eye 
bariatro may be a lone dissident taking on the  </p>
<p t="663520" d="7440">world&#39;s largest government but he is convinced his 
is no exercise in futility you said you admire the  </p>
<p t="670960" d="5360">mythological figure sisyphus right what 
do you mean by that his mission seems like  </p>
<p t="677040" d="4160">doomed that he will never push the 
rock to the very top of the mountain</p>
<p t="683520" d="5120">it&#39;s a bit like me when i&#39;m creating 
artworks to challenge chinese regime  </p>
<p t="689440" d="4800">i don&#39;t know when it will be changed or i 
don&#39;t know if my work would change it at all</p>
<p t="696400" d="8240">but even if that is a reality does it mean my 
work has no meaning i don&#39;t think so in september  </p>
<p t="704640" d="5280">body itself brought out his paintbrush to convey 
his outrage for china&#39;s crackdown on hong kong  </p>
<p t="710560" d="5520">fashioning hong kong&#39;s leader carrie lamb as a 
puppet of xi jinping bariatro melded their faces  </p>
<p t="717440" d="6160">last month in northern italy a center of art that 
combined image greeted visitors as bariatro held  </p>
<p t="723600" d="5680">his first major solo exhibition in the city 
of bresha it almost didn&#39;t happen at the last  </p>
<p t="729280" d="5280">minute china tried to flex its muscle they&#39;re 
actually writing threatening letters it&#39;s like  </p>
<p t="734560" d="6160">a blackmailing you know if you do bodytalk show 
then maybe in the future our collaboration will  </p>
<p t="740720" d="6480">be problematic specifically the chinese embassy 
in rome demanded the show be cancelled because  </p>
<p t="747200" d="6960">the exhibition was full of anti-chinese lies would 
seriously wound the feelings of the chinese people  </p>
<p t="754720" d="6320">and posed a threat to friendly relations between 
china and italy the italian authorities held  </p>
<p t="761040" d="6240">firm and the show went on there was a nod 
to what bodhitsau sees as xi&#39;s willfully  </p>
<p t="767280" d="5920">slow response to covet and he paid homage to 
the uyghur minority that china has imprisoned  </p>
<p t="774080" d="5120">to what extent are you representing the people who 
can&#39;t express themselves inside china i think this  </p>
<p t="779200" d="8000">is the reality that chinese people do not have 
a sense of safety that they can speak freely  </p>
<p t="787760" d="7200">but i am in this very privileged position that 
i&#39;m not in china so i have every responsibility  </p>
<p t="794960" d="4880">to make my voice to be 
heard to become their voices</p>
