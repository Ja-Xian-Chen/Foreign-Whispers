was sort of developed at the national lampoon was  </p>
<p t="432480" d="5360">when i was 30 it was an exaggeration now that 
i&#39;m 47 it is what we technically call a lie  </p>
<p t="439680" d="4560">i do drink but uh that&#39;s probably about the about 
the end of it what&#39;s the difference between your  </p>
<p t="444240" d="5600">persona and the real pj or uh the person is louder 
and dumber you know this is basically because i i  </p>
<p t="449840" d="5360">use myself as a clown figure in the work it&#39;s 
nice to have somebody in the story that you  </p>
<p t="455200" d="3520">know is not going to sue you that you can say 
absolutely anything about you can make them do  </p>

i&#39;ll use the next sentence to explain well it&#39;s  </p>
<p t="481840" d="5680">not really quite true you know you can always back 
off a joke you know that&#39;s the nice thing about  </p>
<p t="487520" d="4880">jokes incidentally you can&#39;t back off a serious 
statement the story will continue after this</p>
<p t="495680" d="4880">in his latest book all the trouble in the world 
he goes after environmentalists population  </p>
<p t="500560" d="5680">planners and others whom he calls professional 
warriors and whiners among other things he hates  </p>

berkeley california and al gore he&#39;s willing  </p>
<p t="512400" d="6560">to offend almost everyone even advocates for the 
handicap he calls them compassion fascists and he  </p>
<p t="518960" d="5280">says they&#39;ve been at work building a ramp at the 
post office in peterborough new hampshire this  </p>
<p t="525440" d="4560">wheelchair ramp in front of the post office this 
was required by the americans with disabilities  </p>
<p t="530000" d="7520">act and this is a long and fairly steep and fairly 
narrow ramp i think basically you&#39;d have to be a  </p>
<p t="537520" d="6320">special olympics athlete to get your wheelchair up 
this thing o&#39;rourke says there&#39;s a more convenient  </p>
<p t="543840" d="5920">ramp at the post office&#39;s back door it&#39;s been 
there since the 1930s and has worked just fine  </p>
<p t="549760" d="4320">but according to the americans with disabilities 
act that&#39;s not good enough because that treats  </p>
<p t="554080" d="4480">people with disabilities differently than the 
rest of us are treated and so there has to be a  </p>
<p t="558560" d="4880">ramp in the front and the only thing it&#39;s used 
for is kids on skateboards the advocates would  </p>
<p t="563440" d="6400">seem to have the law and some would argue logic on 
their side oh you can have logic on your side no  </p>
<p t="569840" d="5200">problem what i&#39;m saying is they don&#39;t have common 
sense on their side and a lot of human life should  </p>
<p t="575040" d="6000">be guided most of human life should be guided by 
common sense and not by legal quibbling that seems  </p>
<p t="581040" d="6240">like a really hard approach i mean to go after the 
disabilities act american disabilities act i mean  </p>
<p t="587280" d="6880">that seems like such a heartless position totally 
devoid of humanity how could anybody possibly be  </p>
<p t="594160" d="5760">against good things for the disabled how could 
anybody take such a rotten awful position as that  </p>
<p t="599920" d="6560">well i can and it&#39;s for this reason is that the 
the purpose of this law was to make george bush  </p>
<p t="606480" d="3840">feel good and to make congress people feel good 
and to a certain extent i suppose make voters  </p>
<p t="610320" d="4640">feel good this ramp doesn&#39;t helping anybody with 
disabilities there already was a ramp nobody with  </p>
<p t="614960" d="5360">disabilities is using this ramp this ramp is 
there&#39;s a hundred thousand dollar monument to  </p>
<p t="620960" d="6720">patting oneself upon the back some of his friends 
say o&#39;rourke is a lot more sophisticated than  </p>
<p t="627680" d="5200">he lets on that he writes for effect and for 
sales you really believe everything you write  </p>
<p t="634320" d="7120">oh good question of course not you know but 
uh i think that there&#39;s you know there there&#39;s  </p>
<p t="641440" d="5280">some root cause some seed some kernel in there of 
some of something that i believe you know uh i&#39;m  </p>
<p t="646720" d="4720">a humorous do i exaggerate for a fact of course i 
exaggerate for a fact some people have said and i  </p>
<p t="651440" d="6640">know you&#39;ve probably read it you know pj is very 
calculated um go back and look at him when he was  </p>
<p t="658960" d="4640">writing for harry and he was a hippie then 
he turns up at the national lampoon as an  </p>
<p t="663600" d="5520">editor then he goes to work for rolling stone a 
politically liberal publication and now when it&#39;s  </p>
<p t="669120" d="6800">become fashionable to be conservative and right 
wing what you&#39;re doing is becoming a conservative  </p>
<p t="675920" d="5440">commentator that really you&#39;re an opportunist 
definitely you know there&#39;s no doubt about that i  </p>
<p t="681360" d="5280">am i&#39;m very ambitious person and um i was a hippie 
when it was fun to be hippie it would have been  </p>
<p t="686640" d="5920">very stupid to have been a hippie in the 50s 
and even stupider to be one in the 80s but  </p>
<p t="692560" d="3280">the end of the 60s beginning of the 
70s it was a great time to be a hippie  </p>
<p t="695840" d="6720">but definitely i&#39;m not an artist you know i i&#39;m 
a journalist and i like to get stuff published  </p>
<p t="702560" d="6000">i like to make money and i like to get a 
lot of readers if i possibly can and so  </p>
<p t="709680" d="6160">have i changed with the times well god what a 
strange person i would be if i hadn&#39;t you know</p>
