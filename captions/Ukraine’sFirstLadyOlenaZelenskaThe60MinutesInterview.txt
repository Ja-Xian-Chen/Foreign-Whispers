<p t="1459" d="5531">In a major escalation of the war in Europe,
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced</p>
<p t="6990" d="4760">Friday he is annexing about 20% of Ukraine.</p>
<p t="11750" d="5179">The region, in the east and in the south,
is only partly controlled by Russia because</p>
<p t="16929" d="2560">of a Ukrainian counteroffensive.</p>
<p t="19489" d="6940">In a belligerent speech, Putin referred to
nuclear weapons, and accused the west of satanism.</p>
<p t="26429" d="4250">He vowed that the territory will be Russian
“forever.”</p>
<p t="30679" d="5040">President Biden responded that the U.S. will
never recognize the annexation and will support</p>
<p t="35719" d="4311">Ukraine&#39;s military as long as it takes.</p>
<p t="40030" d="6209">Seven months of war have been catastrophic
for Ukrainian families, many of whom turn</p>
<p t="46239" d="3590">for hope to Olena Zelenska.</p>
<p t="49829" d="5931">The first lady of Ukraine was trained as an
architect, made a living as a comedy writer,</p>
<p t="55760" d="3200">but awoke last February to a tragedy.</p>
<p t="58960" d="6700">Overnight, she became an ambassador, a mourner,
and the healer of a nation fighting for its</p>
<p t="65660" d="7910">life.</p>
<p t="73570" d="7440">We met in the capital, Kyiv, at a location
we agreed not to disclose the day of our interview.</p>
<p t="81010" d="6330">Ukraine was forcing a Russian retreat, and
exposing the horrors of the invasion.</p>
<p t="87340" d="3989">Scott Pelley: What have the families of Ukraine
lost?</p>
<p t="91329" d="7860">Olena Zelenska (translated): Half [our] families
are separated, [Because] someone is at the</p>
<p t="99189" d="6601">front, someone went abroad to save their children,
someone is under [Russian] occupation.</p>
<p t="105790" d="3400">People are afraid to leave their [homes] because
of shelling.</p>
<p t="109190" d="3469">They’re afraid to even try to evacuate.</p>
<p t="112659" d="1960">We have thousands of dead.</p>
<p t="114619" d="2161">Hundreds of children are dead.</p>
<p t="116780" d="7180">Scott Pelley: We were just in Chernihiv, we
saw the soccer stadium had been bombed.</p>
<p t="123960" d="7310">The library, a hospital, Public School Number
18, Public School Number 21.</p>
<p t="131270" d="4090">What are the Russians trying to do?</p>
<p t="135360" d="4870">Olena Zelenska (translated): They try to frighten
people to make them run, to have towns and</p>
<p t="140230" d="3560">villages empty so they can occupy these territories.</p>
<p t="143790" d="4160">Scott Pelley: Is it warfare or is it terrorism?</p>
<p t="147950" d="3210">Olena Zelenska (translated): Definitely, terrorism.</p>
<p t="151160" d="6620">The war is being waged using modern means,
but from the moral and ethical point of view,</p>
<p t="157780" d="3720">[it’s] the Middle Ages.</p>
<p t="161500" d="6570">Olena Zelenska is 44 years old, married 19
years to her husband, President Volodymyr</p>
<p t="168070" d="1080">Zelenskyy.</p>
<p t="169150" d="7070">Their names differ because in Slavic languages,
surnames are often modified by gender.</p>
<p t="176220" d="8730">When we spoke to her husband in early April,
he told us his wife and two children were</p>
<p t="184950" d="1210">in hiding.</p>
<p t="186160" d="4350">But weeks later, he deployed his wife like
a weapon.</p>
<p t="190510" d="6080">In May, she showed First Lady Jill Biden the
war’s homeless in western Ukraine.</p>
<p t="196590" d="9280">In July, she came to Washington and became
the first, first lady to address the U.S.</p>
<p t="205870" d="1000">Congress.</p>
<p t="206870" d="5690">“I’m asking for weapons,” she said then,
“weapons that would not be used to wage</p>
<p t="212560" d="6030">war on somebody’s else’s land, but to
protect one’s home and the right to wake</p>
<p t="218590" d="3200">up alive in that home.”</p>
<p t="221790" d="6380">When we met, we noticed what seemed like a
weariness she was determined to ignore.</p>
<p t="228170" d="6120">It was the price of the path she’d chosen—to
meet her people, know their pain and bear</p>
<p t="234290" d="2130">the weight of empathy.</p>
<p t="236420" d="6730">Scott Pelley: We met a man in Bucha yesterday.</p>
<p t="243150" d="3900">He and his family were fleeing the Russian
invasion.</p>
<p t="247050" d="3990">The Russians opened fire on his car.</p>
<p t="251040" d="6669">His leg was destroyed, the car caught fire
and he watched his wife and children burn</p>
<p t="257709" d="2800">to death.</p>
<p t="260509" d="8581">I find it hard to express the enormity of
what&#39;s happening, and I wonder how you express</p>
<p t="269090" d="1829">the suffering of your people.</p>
<p t="270919" d="5000">Olena Zelenska (translated): I feel like a
part of these people.</p>
<p t="275919" d="2801">I feel as if this is my pain.</p>
<p t="278720" d="5699">[The] stories are terrifying and we try to
somehow help the survivors.</p>
<p t="284419" d="3180">You just told me this man in Bucha had lost
his leg.</p>
<p t="287599" d="6201">Well, a girl Sasha, lost her arm.</p>
<p t="293800" d="1839">Now she’s in the United States.</p>
<p t="295639" d="6120">[I started a program with] the Ukraine House
in Washington and [with] many American philanthropists</p>
<p t="301759" d="3750">and American doctors and hospitals.</p>
<p t="305509" d="11981">We found an opportunity to give the girl an
artificial prosthesis.</p>
<p t="317490" d="5000">But every time she looks at her hands, she
will see what she has lost.</p>
<p t="322490" d="5799">Sasha will always see what she lost in this
war.</p>
<p t="328289" d="5341">The world has watched, as Ukraine has lost
entire cities.</p>
<p t="333630" d="4740">Nearly 500 hospitals and clinics have been
hit.</p>
<p t="338370" d="3599">Schools are devastated, Mrs. Zelenska told
us.</p>
<p t="341969" d="4381">Olena Zelenska (translated): About 150 schools
simply do not exist.</p>
<p t="346350" d="3550">About 900 schools have been damaged.</p>
<p t="349900" d="5600">We saw what she means in Chernihiv, about
three hours north of Kyiv.</p>
<p t="355500" d="7529">Public school 21 was used as a shelter when
a Russian bomb struck.</p>
<p t="363029" d="2711">We asked some of those who were there to join
us.</p>
<p t="365740" d="4560">Scott Pelley: Why would the Russians bomb
a school?</p>
<p t="370300" d="6389">Inna Levchenko the school principal told us,
“I thought it was a safe place for all of</p>
<p t="376689" d="1301">us.</p>
<p t="377990" d="6000">We even wrote the word ‘Children’ on the
windows.”</p>
<p t="383990" d="3580">Principal Levchenko lost vision in one eye.</p>
<p t="387570" d="3619">Nataliia Horbach was sheltering with her two
boys.</p>
<p t="391189" d="4871">Nataliia Horbach (translated): My face and
my ear were injured, my head and my right</p>
<p t="396060" d="2550">arm were cut with some fragments.</p>
<p t="398610" d="5920">A man came over and helped me up and took
me to a car that drove us to the hospital.</p>
<p t="404530" d="7770">When he helped me stand up, I asked him about
the…</p>
<p t="412300" d="8040">She couldn’t quite say the word “children.”</p>
<p t="420340" d="4060">Children were wounded, but seven adults were
killed.</p>
<p t="424400" d="4099">Another bomb hit Valentyna Vasylchenko’s
home.</p>
<p t="428499" d="5470">Valentyna Vasylchenko (translated): My grandson&#39;s
heart was still beating.</p>
<p t="433969" d="5540">They were giving him medical assistance, but
a lot of time was lost and he died in the</p>
<p t="439509" d="2981">ambulance near the house.</p>
<p t="442490" d="6780">My granddaughter, her fiancé, my daughter&#39;s
husband, and my mother were found dead in</p>
<p t="449270" d="1130">the rubble.</p>
<p t="450400" d="7340">Scott Pelley: Public School 21 in Chernihiv
had 850 students.</p>
<p t="457740" d="3229">How are you educating the children of Ukraine
today?</p>
<p t="460969" d="5920">Olena Zelenska (translated): Around 3,500
schools will operate online only, because</p>
<p t="466889" d="7090">schools cannot receive students and because
their parents are afraid to send their children</p>
<p t="473979" d="1771">to school.</p>
<p t="475750" d="8349">[Ukraine’s] children went to school this
year… and the first thing they learned [is]</p>
<p t="484099" d="8581">where the bomb shelter is, how to get there
and what to do in case a missile strikes.</p>
<p t="492680" d="1289">We will fight.</p>
<p t="493969" d="3290">We will not give our children up.</p>
<p t="497259" d="4300">I don’t know how we can forgive this.</p>
<p t="501559" d="6561">I don’t think we will.</p>
<p t="508120" d="5400">After the Russians severed communications
with the occupied territories Ukrainians dropped</p>
<p t="513520" d="6100">messages in the Dnipro River – with the
current and against the chance they would</p>
<p t="519620" d="2850">reach those behind the new iron curtain.</p>
<p t="522470" d="5680">Olena Zelenska (translated): We really hope
that our love letters were received by someone</p>
<p t="528150" d="2020">there and that they hear us.</p>
<p t="530170" d="3760">I truly hope [our people] will endure.</p>
<p t="533930" d="3930">We will never give [up our people].</p>
<p t="537860" d="7410">And by the way, [there is this idea of giving
up territory in some kind of negotiation.]</p>
<p t="545270" d="2420">Our people are there.</p>
<p t="547690" d="2340">We will never betray them.</p>
<p t="550030" d="6150">Scott Pelley: That is not negotiable in the
view of your government.</p>
<p t="556180" d="5240">Olena Zelenska (translated): I really don&#39;t
want to express political opinions.</p>
<p t="561420" d="3890">That’s not my role.</p>
<p t="565310" d="3730">But imagine a situation where you&#39;ve been
attacked by bandits.</p>
<p t="569040" d="6000">They are threatening you, killing your children.</p>
<p t="575040" d="4060">And someone [suggests] maybe, it would be
better to negotiate?</p>
<p t="579100" d="3650">[That] is impossible now.</p>
<p t="582750" d="5510">This is just my opinion as a citizen of Ukraine.</p>
<p t="588260" d="6210">Olena Zelenska dated her future husband in
college she became a writer on Zelenskyy’s</p>
<p t="594470" d="4290">comedy shows.</p>
<p t="598760" d="5050">In a sitcom called “Servant of the People,”
he played a teacher who is elected president</p>
<p t="603810" d="1560">of Ukraine.</p>
<p t="605370" d="8120">He turned parody into power in 2019 when he
actually ran and won 73% of the vote.</p>
<p t="613490" d="4150">The Zelenskyy’s have an 18-year-old daughter
and 9-year-old son.</p>
<p t="617640" d="4230">Scott Pelley: Are you stronger than you thought
you were?</p>
<p t="621870" d="5160">Olena Zelenska (translated): Everyone has
become stronger.</p>
<p t="627030" d="2990">I’m not unique.</p>
<p t="630020" d="5670">You survive and going through trials you automatically
become stronger.</p>
<p t="635690" d="4520">So yes, we are getting stronger, but will
that help us?</p>
<p t="640210" d="1000">I hope so.</p>
<p t="641210" d="6310">Scott Pelley: Madam First Lady, may I show
you some photographs from the United States?</p>
<p t="647520" d="5590">This is a picture I took on Fifth Avenue in
New York.</p>
<p t="653110" d="5910">This is San Francisco.</p>
<p t="659020" d="6950">This is a home in the state of Florida.</p>
<p t="665970" d="4880">This is a bumper sticker where I buy my groceries.</p>
<p t="670850" d="6770">I took this picture on the east side of Manhattan.</p>
<p t="677620" d="5250">This is a baseball game in Denver, Colorado.</p>
<p t="682870" d="8420">And this is from Florida as well.</p>
<p t="691290" d="3130">What do you say to the American people?</p>
<p t="694420" d="5410">Olena Zelenska (translated): I can say I really
feel the support.</p>
<p t="699830" d="4280">When I was in Washington, I was handed a short
letter written by a guy, named Hector.</p>
<p t="704110" d="3010">He’s a teenager, 14 years old.</p>
<p t="707120" d="3500">He wrote me a short letter with words of support.</p>
<p t="710620" d="5490">By the way, if possible, and Hector sees this
program, I would like to tell him.</p>
<p t="716110" d="5960">Olena Zelenska (in English): Dear Hector,
I remember it, I took your letter with me</p>
<p t="722070" d="3000">to Ukraine.</p>
<p t="725070" d="3250">And it was charming and it was extremely touching.</p>
<p t="728320" d="6230">Olena Zelenska (translated): So, it seems
to me that normal people understand what evil</p>
<p t="734550" d="3440">is and that the attacker is evil.</p>
<p t="737990" d="5830">That it is normal to defend your country,
your children, your homes.</p>
<p t="743820" d="4060">I am sure that Americans themselves are like
that.</p>
<p t="747880" d="3800">Scott Pelley: What does the future hold?</p>
<p t="751680" d="5490">Olena Zelenska (translated): We are dreaming
about this.</p>
<p t="757170" d="4810">Over these months we’ve seen the human being
is the center of everything.</p>
<p t="761980" d="3030">This is what makes us different from the aggressor.</p>
<p t="765010" d="2120">They don’t count their [dead].</p>
<p t="767130" d="6070">We count every person who died and we want
everyone still alive to feel confident and</p>
<p t="773200" d="4280">to have opportunities [to grow].</p>
<p t="777480" d="3310">That’s what we dream about.</p>
<p t="780790" d="4410">That’s how we want to see our country in
the future.</p>
