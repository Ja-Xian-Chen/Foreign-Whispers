<p t="1709" d="5880">Mark Esper is a Washington insider who spent
his whole career flying below the radar – until</p>
<p t="7589" d="4001">he became President Donald Trump’s second
secretary of defense.</p>
<p t="11590" d="5900">A West Point graduate and paratrooper, Esper
spent 10 years as a by-the-book Army officer.</p>
<p t="17490" d="5150">And when he left active duty, he moved through
the revolving doors of think tank jobs, Capitol</p>
<p t="22640" d="3520">Hill &amp; Pentagon staff positions, and defense
lobbying.</p>
<p t="26160" d="5369">It all turned out to be boot camp for his
assignment as defense secretary -- and a face-off</p>
<p t="31529" d="4881">with Mr. Trump, whom he came to regard as
a threat to American democracy.</p>
<p t="36410" d="7989">But we begin tonight with the former defense
secretary&#39;s thoughts on Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine.</p>
<p t="44399" d="9930">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Overall, how would you grade
President Biden and his administration&#39;s--</p>
<p t="54329" d="2621">performance in terms of Ukraine?</p>
<p t="56950" d="1249">Mark Esper: It&#39;s mixed.</p>
<p t="58199" d="2221">They had a shaky start.</p>
<p t="60420" d="3360">I would&#39;ve never taken the military option
off the table, for example.</p>
<p t="63780" d="4110">I don&#39;t understand the reluctance to provide--
the Ukrainians with MiGs</p>
<p t="67890" d="1000">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Fighter jets.</p>
<p t="68890" d="1030">Mark Esper: Fighter jets, that&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="69920" d="1520">But-- since then, it&#39;s picked up.</p>
<p t="71440" d="4069">I think we&#39;re now flowing more supplies and
material and weapons into Ukraine.</p>
<p t="75509" d="3921">I think they&#39;ve done a good job of bringing
the allies along, which is important.</p>
<p t="79430" d="1530">You-- you have to act collectively.</p>
<p t="80960" d="4111">And you have to give some credit, by the way,
to the Congress, which I think-- you know,</p>
<p t="85071" d="4449">in the few-- few issues that has unified Congress
has been this one, support for Ukraine.</p>
<p t="89520" d="1419">And in some ways, they&#39;ve led the administration.</p>
<p t="90939" d="5871">So it&#39;s good to see now Congress and the Executive
Branch-- acting together, reasonably aligned,</p>
<p t="96810" d="1480">to help the Ukrainian people.</p>
<p t="98290" d="5420">Tomorrow, May 9, marks an important day on
the Russian calendar, victory in World War</p>
<p t="103710" d="1000">II.</p>
<p t="104710" d="3189">Mark Esper: Well, I think the conventional
wisdom right now seems to be that by May 9th--</p>
<p t="107899" d="5960">Putin is gonna try and secure Donbass, which
would be-- occupying the rest of the Donetsk</p>
<p t="113859" d="4001">and Luhansk provinces, if you will, and declare
them protected.</p>
<p t="117860" d="6310">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Is there any scenario where
President Putin could take those regions and</p>
<p t="124170" d="1180">then just declare victory?</p>
<p t="125350" d="1240">Mark Esper: Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p t="126590" d="3590">I mean, if I were a betting man today, I&#39;d
say that is what he will do.</p>
<p t="130180" d="4790">He&#39;ll at least secure the-- all of Donbass,
declare that he&#39;s liberated the Russian-speaking</p>
<p t="134970" d="2800">peoples of that region, and declare victory.</p>
<p t="137770" d="2780">And that will become another frozen conflict.</p>
<p t="140550" d="4500">Mark Esper’s time as secretary of defense
began when he was overwhelmingly confirmed</p>
<p t="145050" d="5180">by the Senate, 90-8, on July 23, 2019.</p>
<p t="150230" d="5730">Two days later, on a phone call with President
Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump asked for a “favor”</p>
<p t="155960" d="2940">while he was holding up aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p t="158900" d="2430">The call ultimately led to his impeachment.</p>
<p t="161330" d="4420">Norah O&#39;Donnell: You had to keep pressing
President Trump to release $250 million in</p>
<p t="165750" d="1000">aid to Ukraine?</p>
<p t="166750" d="2830">Mark Esper: Yes, it would be an argument after
an argument.</p>
<p t="169580" d="4330">And I&#39;d have to say, &quot;Look, Mr. President,
at the end of the day, Congress appropriated.</p>
<p t="173910" d="1310">It&#39;s-- it&#39;s the law.</p>
<p t="175220" d="1090">We have to do it.&quot;</p>
<p t="176310" d="4570">Esper writes in his new memoir, “A Sacred
Oath,” that the Ukraine affair was an early</p>
<p t="180880" d="3640">source of tension between him and President
Trump.</p>
<p t="184520" d="4620">That tension would grow, as he told us when
we met him at his alma mater, West Point.</p>
<p t="189140" d="3580">Mark Esper: Because It&#39;s important to our
country, it&#39;s important to the republic, the</p>
<p t="192720" d="4510">American people, that they understand what
was going on in this very consequential period.</p>
<p t="197230" d="2080">The last year of the Trump administration.</p>
<p t="199310" d="1870">And to tell the story about things we prevented.</p>
<p t="201180" d="1000">Really bad things.</p>
<p t="202180" d="3600">Dangerous things that could have taken the
country in-- in a dark direction.</p>
<p t="205780" d="2360">Norah O&#39;Donnell: What kind of terrible things
did you prevent?</p>
<p t="208140" d="4170">Mark Esper: At various times-- during the--
certainly the last year of the administration,</p>
<p t="212310" d="4500">you know, folks in the White House are proposing
to take military action against Venezuela.</p>
<p t="216810" d="2870">To-- to-- to strike Iran.</p>
<p t="219680" d="3560">At one point, somebody propose we blockade
Cuba.</p>
<p t="223240" d="4620">These ideas would happen-- it seemed, every--
every few weeks.</p>
<p t="227860" d="2310">Something like this would come up and we&#39;d
have to swat &#39;em down.</p>
<p t="230170" d="1920">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Who&#39;s &quot;we had to swat &#39;em
down?&quot;</p>
<p t="232090" d="1710">Mark Esper: Well, mostly me.</p>
<p t="233800" d="2800">I had good support from-- from General Mark
Milley.</p>
<p t="236600" d="4200">Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff General Mark Milley ran the Army</p>
<p t="240800" d="4750">for over a year before finding themselves
in charge at the Pentagon.</p>
<p t="245550" d="3900">in order to deal with what he calls some of
the “crazy” ideas coming from the White</p>
<p t="249450" d="3130">House, Esper and Milley came up with a system.</p>
<p t="252580" d="2070">Mark Esper: I come up with this idea.</p>
<p t="254650" d="3580">Actually, Mark Milley and I discuss it-- what
we call the &quot;Four No&#39;s&quot;.</p>
<p t="258230" d="6089">The four things we had to prevent from happening
between then and the election.</p>
<p t="264319" d="6880">And one was no strategic retreats, no unnecessary
wars, no politi-- politicization of the military,</p>
<p t="271199" d="1921">and no misuse of the military.</p>
<p t="273120" d="4280">And so, as we went through the next five to
six months, that became the metric by which</p>
<p t="277400" d="1509">we would measure things.</p>
<p t="278909" d="6181">Esper told us he had reason to be concerned,
not just about an unnecessary military conflict</p>
<p t="285090" d="5060">with an adversary but with one of our closest
neighbors and largest trading partners.</p>
<p t="290150" d="4720">Mark Esper: The president pulls me aside on
at least a couple of occasions and suggests</p>
<p t="294870" d="4130">that maybe we have the U.S. military shoot
missiles into Mexico--</p>
<p t="299000" d="2409">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Shoot missiles into Mexico
for what?</p>
<p t="301409" d="2641">Mark Esper: He would say to-- to go after
the cartels.</p>
<p t="304050" d="3459">And we would have this private discussion
where I&#39;d say, &quot;Mr. President, I-- you know,</p>
<p t="307509" d="1870">I-- I understand the motive.&quot;</p>
<p t="309379" d="3000">Because he was very serious about dealing
with drugs in America.</p>
<p t="312379" d="4040">I get that, we all understand, but I had to
explain to him, &quot;We-- we can&#39;t do that.</p>
<p t="316419" d="1581">It would violate international law.</p>
<p t="318000" d="2520">It would be terrible for our neighbors to
the south.</p>
<p t="320520" d="2139">It would, you know, impact us in so many ways.</p>
<p t="322659" d="1530">Why-- why don&#39;t we do this instead?&quot;</p>
<p t="324189" d="4081">Norah O&#39;Donnell: You politely push back on
the idea.</p>
<p t="328270" d="3660">Did President Trump really say, &quot;No one would
know it was us?&quot;</p>
<p t="331930" d="1160">Mark Esper: Yes.</p>
<p t="333090" d="1000">Yes.</p>
<p t="334090" d="1199">I-- I-- he-- he said that.</p>
<p t="335289" d="2241">And I-- I just thought it was fanciful, right?</p>
<p t="337530" d="1580">Because, of course, it would be us.</p>
<p t="339110" d="2399">I was reluctant to tell this story.</p>
<p t="341509" d="2990">Because I think-- I-- I thought, people won&#39;t
believe this.</p>
<p t="344499" d="5591">That they&#39;ll think I&#39;m just making it up and
folks in-- in-- in Trump&#39;s orbit will-- will</p>
<p t="350090" d="1000">dispute it.</p>
<p t="351090" d="5259">And then I was having dinner-- after the election
in 2020 with a fellow Cabinet member.</p>
<p t="356349" d="4651">And-- and he said to me, he goes, &quot;You know,
remember that time when President Trump suggested</p>
<p t="361000" d="3440">you shoot mess-- m-- missiles into Mexico?&quot;</p>
<p t="364440" d="1449">And I said to him, &quot;You-- you heard that?&quot;</p>
<p t="365889" d="1000">He goes, &quot;Oh, yeah.</p>
<p t="366889" d="1020">I-- I couldn&#39;t believe it.</p>
<p t="367909" d="2870">And I couldn&#39;t believe how-- how well you
managed and talked him down from that.&quot;</p>
<p t="370779" d="2700">And at that moment, I knew I gotta write the
story.</p>
<p t="373479" d="3671">Because at least have one witness who will
verify that this really did happen.</p>
<p t="377150" d="4889">When asked whether Esper’s story about Mexico
was true, Donald Trump said in a statement</p>
<p t="382039" d="2840">to 60 Minutes, “no comment.”</p>
<p t="384879" d="4870">Esper says to fact-check his book, he sent
all – or parts of -- his manuscript to more</p>
<p t="389749" d="5730">than two dozen current and former four-star
officers, senior civilians from the Pentagon,</p>
<p t="395479" d="1280">and cabinet members.</p>
<p t="396759" d="7071">60 Minutes spoke to six of them who said what
they read was accurate.</p>
<p t="403830" d="4739">During the late spring of 2020, it was not
a foreign crisis, but the murder of George</p>
<p t="408569" d="6291">Floyd in Minneapolis, that Esper calls a turning
point in his time as secretary of defense.</p>
<p t="414860" d="6399">On the night of May 31 in Washington, protests
for racial justice were marred by rioters</p>
<p t="421259" d="5440">who set parts of Washington ablaze and, Esper
says, enraged President Trump.</p>
<p t="426699" d="4800">At a meeting the next morning, Esper told
us, the commander-in-chief was on the verge</p>
<p t="431499" d="4551">of ordering 10,000 active-duty troops into
the streets of the Capital.</p>
<p t="436050" d="3320">Norah O&#39;Donnell: What was the most disturbing
thing that the president said during that</p>
<p t="439370" d="1060">meeting on June 1st?</p>
<p t="440430" d="4060">Mark Esper: The president is ranting at--
at the room.</p>
<p t="444490" d="3010">He&#39;s using a lot of, you know-- foul language.</p>
<p t="447500" d="2639">You know, &quot;You-- y-- you all are f-in&#39; losers,&quot;
right?</p>
<p t="450139" d="2481">And then he says it to the vice president,
Mike Pence.</p>
<p t="452620" d="2669">He-- he&#39;s usin&#39; the same language and he&#39;s
lookin&#39; at Pence.</p>
<p t="455289" d="1560">Norah O&#39;Donnell: He called Mike Pence--</p>
<p t="456849" d="1000">Mark Esper: H-- he di--</p>
<p t="457849" d="1000">Norah O&#39;Donnell: --an f-in&#39; loser?</p>
<p t="458849" d="2120">Mark Esper: --he didn&#39;t-- he didn&#39;t call him
directly, but he was looking at him when he</p>
<p t="460969" d="1530">was saying it.</p>
<p t="462499" d="4341">And it really caught my attention, and I thought,
that-- we&#39;re at a different spot now.</p>
<p t="466840" d="7350">He&#39;s gonna finally give a direct order to
deploy paratroopers into the streets of Washington,</p>
<p t="474190" d="1000">D.C.</p>
<p t="475190" d="1249">And I&#39;m thinking with weapons and bayonets.</p>
<p t="476439" d="1510">This would be horrible.</p>
<p t="477949" d="5161">Norah O&#39;Donnell: What specifically was he
suggesting that the U.S. military should do</p>
<p t="483110" d="1089">to these protesters?</p>
<p t="484199" d="3571">Mark Esper: He says, &quot;Can&#39;t you just shoot
them?</p>
<p t="487770" d="2139">Just shoot them in the legs or something.&quot;</p>
<p t="489909" d="2891">And he&#39;s suggesting that that&#39;s what we should
do, that we should bring in the troops and</p>
<p t="492800" d="1190">shoot the protesters.</p>
<p t="493990" d="5440">Norah O&#39;Donnell: The commander in chief was
suggesting that the U.S. military shoot protesters?</p>
<p t="499430" d="1000">American protesters.</p>
<p t="500430" d="1430">Mark Esper: Yes, in the streets--</p>
<p t="501860" d="1000">Norah O&#39;Donnell: American protesters.</p>
<p t="502860" d="1049">Mark Esper: --of our nation&#39;s capital.</p>
<p t="503909" d="1000">That&#39;s right.</p>
<p t="504909" d="1000">Shocking.</p>
<p t="505909" d="6841">Norah O&#39;Donnell: We have seen in other countries
a government use their military to shoot protesters.</p>
<p t="512750" d="1000">Mark Esper: Right.</p>
<p t="513750" d="1000">Norah O&#39;Donnell: What kinda governments are
those?</p>
<p t="514750" d="1280">Mark Esper: Oh, those are banana republics,
right?</p>
<p t="516030" d="2160">Or-- authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p t="518190" d="3620">We all remember Tiananmen Square, right, in
China</p>
<p t="521810" d="5460">Regarding whether he suggested shooting protesters,
in his statement, former President Trump said,</p>
<p t="527270" d="4320">“this is a complete lie, and 10 witnesses
can back it up.</p>
<p t="531590" d="5660">Mark Esper was weak and totally ineffective,
and because of it, i had to run the military.”</p>
<p t="537250" d="5070">Esper told us he wanted to avoid the president
invoking the Insurrection Act, which would</p>
<p t="542320" d="3050">have allowed Mr. Trump to deploy active-duty
troops.</p>
<p t="545370" d="5720">Instead, Esper says he helped mobilize 5,000
members of the national guard whose mission</p>
<p t="551090" d="3610">includes responding to civil unrest.</p>
<p t="554700" d="5020">And to placate Mr. Trump, Esper writes he
also ordered part of the 82nd Airborne up</p>
<p t="559720" d="1000">from Ft.</p>
<p t="560720" d="3130">Bragg, North Carolina to a base just outside
Washington.</p>
<p t="563850" d="6280">That evening, the U.S. Park Police used force
to clear protestors from Lafayette Park and</p>
<p t="570130" d="2570">the Cabinet was called back to the White House.</p>
<p t="572700" d="2860">Mark Esper: The president greets us.</p>
<p t="575560" d="2430">And I say, &quot;Where are we going?&quot;</p>
<p t="577990" d="5860">And he-- he just ignores it and starts walking
out the door and crossing across the-- the</p>
<p t="583850" d="2300">lawn heading out the gate.</p>
<p t="586150" d="4740">And as we round that corner the press is all
over-- all over the place filming, taking</p>
<p t="590890" d="1000">pictures.</p>
<p t="591890" d="2311">And it-- it just dawned on me at that point
in time that we&#39;d been duped.</p>
<p t="594201" d="1000">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Duped how?</p>
<p t="595201" d="3519">Mark Esper: This is a pol-- this is now a
political stunt, right?</p>
<p t="598720" d="5730">And-- and w-- we-- I allowed myself to be
put in that position.</p>
<p t="604450" d="1300">And it only gets worse, right?</p>
<p t="605750" d="1380">Norah O&#39;Donnell: How does it get worse?</p>
<p t="607130" d="3990">Mark Esper: Well, we end up in Lafayette Park--
up near the church.</p>
<p t="611120" d="3770">And that&#39;s where the president steps out of
the crowd, if you will, goes up, picks up</p>
<p t="614890" d="5590">the Bible and holds it up for everybody to
see and I eventually get directed to come</p>
<p t="620480" d="1390">up and join him.</p>
<p t="621870" d="4680">And-- I made that mistake to-- to kinda be
there in the first place and to join him.</p>
<p t="626550" d="4440">Within 24 hours, Esper says he sent out a
message to employees of the Department of</p>
<p t="630990" d="5290">Defense reminding them they must remain apolitical
and protect freedom of speech.</p>
<p t="636280" d="2420">Then he decided, that wasn’t enough.</p>
<p t="638700" d="2880">Mark Esper: The Republic felt wobbly.</p>
<p t="641580" d="4660">And that&#39;s what prompted me to decide to--
to go before the podium at the Pentagon on</p>
<p t="646240" d="1150">June 3rd and say what I said.</p>
<p t="647390" d="3320">Mark Esper on June 3, 2020: The option to
use active-duty forces in a law enforcement</p>
<p t="650710" d="4980">role should only be used as a matter of last
resort, and only in the most urgent and dire</p>
<p t="655690" d="2180">of situations.</p>
<p t="657870" d="3190">We are not in one of those situations now.</p>
<p t="661060" d="3290">I do not support invoking the Insurrection
Act.</p>
<p t="664350" d="2920">Right after that, Esper was summoned to the
White House.</p>
<p t="667270" d="2580">He says he was sure Donald Trump would fire
him.</p>
<p t="669850" d="2440">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Why did you think he would
fire you?</p>
<p t="672290" d="2540">Mark Esper: Because I publicly rebuked him.</p>
<p t="674830" d="5180">And what I would learn later is-- at the White
House is he thought I took away his authority</p>
<p t="680010" d="1310">to invoke the Insurrection Act.</p>
<p t="681320" d="3670">He did not believe that he had the authority
to impose it.</p>
<p t="684990" d="1130">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Politically, you might have.</p>
<p t="686120" d="2670">Mark Esper: I suppose at a political level,
I-- I did.</p>
<p t="688790" d="1470">But he still had that authority.</p>
<p t="690260" d="2820">What he also knew was I wasn&#39;t gonna go along
with him.</p>
<p t="693080" d="4890">Esper believes President Trump didn’t fire
him at the time because it may have hurt Mr.</p>
<p t="697970" d="2150">Trump’s chances for re-election.</p>
<p t="700120" d="4870">Esper also told us he did not vote for either
Joe Biden or Donald Trump, but mailed in a</p>
<p t="704990" d="1600">ballot for another candidate.</p>
<p t="706590" d="2600">Norah O&#39;Donnell: You&#39;re a lifelong Republican.</p>
<p t="709190" d="7240">But in this book, you detail how you subverted
many of the president&#39;s wishes.</p>
<p t="716430" d="1040">People will say you were disloyal.</p>
<p t="717470" d="4160">Mark Esper: I never disobeyed a direct order
from the president of the United States.</p>
<p t="721630" d="4030">I was fortunate that he often didn&#39;t give
direct orders.</p>
<p t="725660" d="5730">But otherwise, I did what I thought was best
for the nation and for our security, and completely</p>
<p t="731390" d="2380">within the authority granted to me under the
law.</p>
<p t="733770" d="2640">Norah O&#39;Donnell: Critics will say, &quot;Why now
in a book?</p>
<p t="736410" d="2820">Why didn&#39;t you speak out during the Trump
administration?&quot;</p>
<p t="739230" d="1870">Mark Esper: It&#39;s very simple.</p>
<p t="741100" d="3720">If I spoke out at the time, I would be fired,
number one.</p>
<p t="744820" d="4870">And secondly, I had no confidence that anybody
that came in behind me would not be a real</p>
<p t="749690" d="1610">Trump loyalist.</p>
<p t="751300" d="2220">And Lord knows what would&#39;ve happened then.</p>
<p t="753520" d="4840">Esper says six days after the election, he
and his staff could hardly believe they were</p>
<p t="758360" d="1840">still at the Pentagon.</p>
<p t="760200" d="3090">Then he got word that the president planned
to fire him.</p>
<p t="763290" d="4700">The phone rang and Donald Trump’s chief
of staff, Mark Meadows, was on the line.</p>
<p t="767990" d="5220">Norah O&#39;Donnell: You write in the book, he
says, &quot;The president&#39;s not happy with you.</p>
<p t="773210" d="2530">He feels you haven&#39;t supported him enough.&quot;</p>
<p t="775740" d="3610">He added, &quot;You aren&#39;t sufficiently loyal.&quot;</p>
<p t="779350" d="1000">And then you replied?</p>
<p t="780350" d="3720">Mark Esper: I say, you know, &quot;That&#39;s his prerogative,
to fire me.&quot;</p>
<p t="784070" d="3530">But I say, &quot;My oath is to the Constitution,
not to him.&quot;</p>
