0.0,4.64, 60 minutes rewind.
4.64,6.6000000000000005," Next subject, baby boomers."
6.6000000000000005,8.72, Let's begin with a trivia question.
8.72,10.88, Who is the most quoted living American
10.88,13.92, in the Penguin Dictionary of Humorous Quotations?
13.92,17.42," Woody Allen, Steve Martin, Johnny Carson,"
17.42,19.16, Ruhl.
19.16,20.32, Here's a clue.
20.32,22.92, His last two books made it to the top of the New York Times
22.92,24.400000000000002, bestseller list.
24.400000000000002,26.16, Still don't know?
26.16,28.400000000000002, The answer is PJ O'Rourke.
28.4,29.639999999999997," You may never have heard of him,"
29.639999999999997,32.72," but if you're in your 30s or 40s or early 50s,"
32.72,34.16," believe me, you know him."
34.16,37.32, He's the guy on the leading edge of your generational curve.
37.32,39.08," And college, he was a hippie."
39.08,41.16," And while you were giggling at the National Ampune,"
41.16,42.92, he was the editor-in-chief.
42.92,45.879999999999995," Now that you're getting older and becoming more conservative,"
45.879999999999995,48.36, guess who's become the right wing's favorite political
48.36,50.08, satirist?
50.08,52.68, I am frankly nostalgic for the 1980s
52.68,54.32, when sleeping with the president meant
54.32,56.04, that you'd attended a cabinet meeting.
56.72,58.48, I am.
58.48,60.839999999999996, If you want to know why political incumbents
60.839999999999996,63.28," are in trouble this year, spend some time on the road"
63.28,64.96, with PJ O'Rourke.
64.96,67.36," His suspicious, cynical takes on government"
67.36,70.48, find a friendly audience among small businessmen.
70.48,73.68," And his smart, often smart, alloky view of the world"
73.68,77.28," is struck a chord among his fellow jaded baby boomers,"
77.28,79.52, who crowd into bookstores for his readings.
79.52,82.03999999999999, I find your political observations so astute.
82.03999999999999,84.48, And it made his books like Parliament of Hors
84.48,86.96000000000001, and give war a chance best sellers.
86.96000000000001,89.44," I am a liberal, and I probably should hate everything"
89.44,91.72," right, and maybe it's because I'm an 18 liberal on this way"
91.72,94.12," to be conservative, but I find your..."
94.12,97.04," Good luck, huh?"
97.04,98.56," Like many in his audiences,"
98.56,100.92," he used to wear his hair long, smoked dope,"
100.92,103.2, and believe in free sex.
103.2,105.44," But as he's gotten older and more prosperous,"
105.44,109.4," he's become less of a libertine and more of a libertarian,"
109.4,112.4, which means he harbors a deep suspicion of government
112.4,113.80000000000001, at all levels.
113.84,116.24, We've got two political parties in this country.
116.24,117.24, We've got the Democrats.
117.24,118.75999999999999, They're the party of government activism.
118.75999999999999,120.6, The party that says the government can make you
120.6,124.03999999999999," richer, smarter, taller, take a dozen strokes off your golf game,"
124.03999999999999,124.92, you know?
124.92,126.0, And they're the Republicans.
126.0,127.92," They're the party that says government doesn't work,"
127.92,129.72, and then they get elected and proven.
129.72,131.8, LAUGHTER
131.8,135.72," A work was born in 1947, the height of the baby boom."
135.72,138.36," He grew up in suburban Toledo, Ohio."
138.36,140.16, His father was a Buick dealer.
140.16,143.6, It was a typical conservative Midwestern childhood.
143.6,146.44," And like many of his generation, in college,"
146.44,149.72, he underwent a temporary conversion to the counterculture.
149.72,153.51999999999998," He says now, because he thought it would improve his social life."
153.51999999999998,155.76, You were a hippie. You were a child of the 60s.
155.76,157.12, You were a hippie. Yeah.
157.12,159.12," Yeah, I was."
159.12,163.04," When it came to letting go of bourgeois proprieties,"
163.04,165.04, I let go with both hands.
165.04,167.04, LAUGHTER
167.04,169.28, It's definitely up to my neck and neck.
169.28,172.72, You tried all of the aspects of the lifestyle.
172.72,175.16," Lots of drugs, lots of screaming about capitalism,"
175.16,176.96, lots of protesting against the war in Vietnam.
176.96,178.32, I was very self-serving.
178.32,180.24, I was trying to send me to the war in Vietnam.
180.24,181.92, So of course I was against it.
181.92,184.52, But sex drugs and rock and roll didn't stop
184.52,186.24," or work from earning a degree,"
186.24,189.56," winning a scholarship to graduate school at Johns Hopkins,"
189.56,194.04, and starting an underground newspaper in Baltimore called Harry.
194.04,197.04," When he realized there was no future in the revolution,"
197.04,200.52," he headed off to New York City and the National Lampoon,"
200.52,203.16, where he quickly discovered that subversive humor
203.16,206.92000000000002, fetched a far better paycheck than subversive politics.
206.92000000000002,208.76000000000002," By the time he was 31,"
208.76000000000002,211.60000000000002," O'Rourke was editor-in-chief of the Lampoon,"
211.60000000000002,213.88, running a multi-million dollar enterprise
213.88,216.92000000000002," turning out a slick, glossy monthly collection"
216.92000000000002,219.4," of sophomore a humor about breasts,"
219.4,221.64000000000001," buttocks, and ethnic attributes."
221.64000000000001,222.84, Let's read me about the Australians.
222.84,224.44," Australians, yes."
224.44,226.60000000000002," Racial characteristics, violently loud,"
226.60000000000002,229.0, alcoholic rough necks who's idea of fun
229.0,230.6, is to throw up on your car.
230.6,233.0," Yeah, never go to Australia again."
233.0,234.6, You couldn't write this anymore.
234.6,237.24," Nah, I'm all grown up."
237.24,241.24, The complete freedom from ever worrying about offending anybody.
241.24,243.0, I think there's probably the nicest thing
243.0,244.04," about the National Lampoon,"
244.04,247.24, because if it ever crept into your mind
247.24,249.16," that this might offend somebody,"
249.16,251.24, the natural and immediate response
251.24,252.92000000000002," as a trained Lampooner was,"
252.92000000000002,256.84," yes, that's a fabulous idea."
256.84,258.84, Let's do two of them.
259.16,260.52, Everything was a target.
260.52,261.8, Everything was a target.
261.8,264.44," We had, it was so much fun at the National Lampoon,"
264.44,267.64, because it was truly an adolescence dream.
267.64,269.32, So then you went to work for Rolling Stone.
269.32,271.48," Then I went to work for Rolling Stone, right?"
271.48,274.92, I moved right up the stairway of respectability.
274.92,278.92," It was a really solid, old, respectable middle class"
278.92,280.84, in that same institution.
280.84,282.12, Rolling Stone.
282.12,285.24," That was 13 years ago, and he's still there."
285.24,287.4, Using the same subversive sense of humor
287.4,291.64, he developed at the Lampoon to report on serious events.
291.64,294.35999999999996," He's become the Rock Magazine's reactionary,"
294.35999999999996,297.15999999999997, combining the literary flair of Hunter Thompson
297.15999999999997,300.84, with the ideology and habbert ashery of George Will.
300.84,302.52," He holds the impressive title,"
302.52,304.28," Foreign Affairs Desk Chief,"
304.28,306.67999999999995, which he says looks great on the mast head.
306.67999999999995,309.64, But there is no Foreign Affairs Desk at Rolling Stone.
309.64,311.56, In O'Rourke never goes to the office.
313.08,315.96, Most of the time he operates out of the trunk of a rental car
315.96,318.2, and some godforsaken part of the world
318.2,320.68, nursing an inherently weak constitution
320.68,323.4, with bottles of Pepto Bismol.
323.4,325.79999999999995, We caught up with him and his ever-present cigar
325.79999999999995,328.2," last summer in southern Mexico,"
328.2,331.15999999999997, where he was covering that country's national elections.
331.15999999999997,334.76," OK, they've got one political party that steals every election."
334.76,337.64, We've got two political parties that steal every election.
337.64,340.03999999999996, Now does that make us twice as good or twice as bad?
340.03999999999996,341.71999999999997, It definitely makes us similar.
341.71999999999997,343.96, O'Rourke's first rule of journalism
344.03999999999996,346.2, stay away from people in power.
346.2,349.4, The reason is fundamentally that they lie.
349.4,350.59999999999997, They lie.
350.59999999999997,352.59999999999997, A highly placed government official
352.59999999999997,355.47999999999996, did not get to be in a position of power and importance
355.47999999999996,357.24, by being stupid enough to tell the truth
357.24,359.4, to the newspaper reporters.
359.4,363.0," Instead, O'Rourke relies on observation and attitude."
363.0,365.4," He is the star of his own stories,"
365.4,368.84, the misadventures of an innocent abroad in strange lands.
368.84,372.03999999999996, Foreign correspondent loses his patience
372.04,374.6, and his wallet.
374.6,375.96000000000004," What he does, he says,"
375.96000000000004,378.44," is take a very conventional middle-aged,"
378.44,382.28000000000003, midwestern sensibility to some very peculiar places.
382.28000000000003,383.88," On the fall of communism,"
383.88,387.56," a huge, totalitarian system has been brought to its knees"
387.56,390.76, because nobody wants to wear Bulgarian shoes.
390.76,395.24," From the Gulf War, not only is this the first live televised war,"
395.24,399.32000000000005, it's also the first war covered by sober journalists.
399.32,400.92," When his home, P.J.O. Rourke,"
400.92,402.36," leads a disciplined life,"
402.36,405.08," writing a steady 1,000 words a day."
405.08,407.24, He cultivates the literary persona
407.24,410.2," of a cigar-smoking, hard-drinking, fast-driving,"
410.2,412.6," womanizing, martini-guzzling slop."
412.6,413.4, Hot tail time?
413.4,414.36, Hot tail time.
414.36,417.24," But in fact, he lives in a New Hampshire farmhouse"
417.24,419.8, that could have been decorated by Martha Stewart.
419.8,422.12," And his life there is almost bucolic,"
422.12,424.68, more barbecues than bar room brawls.
424.68,428.03999999999996," You never go away hungry and you never go away so bad, right?"
428.04,431.08000000000004," That persona, which was developed at the National Lampoon,"
431.08000000000004,435.08000000000004," was when I was 30, it was an exaggeration."
435.08000000000004,438.04," Now that I'm 47, it is what we technically call a lie."
438.04,439.72, It's not a lie.
439.72,443.0," I do drink, but that's probably about the end of it."
443.0,446.84000000000003, What's the difference between your persona and the real P.J.O. Rourke?
446.84000000000003,448.20000000000005, The persona is louder and dumber.
448.20000000000005,449.8," You know, it's basically what I'm saying."
449.8,452.92, I use myself as a clown figure in the work.
452.92,454.92, It's nice to have somebody in the story
454.92,456.44," that you know is not going to sue you,"
456.44,458.2, that you can say absolutely anything about it.
458.2,459.96, You can make them do any foolish thing
459.96,461.64, and have any ridiculous opinion.
461.64,463.08, And they will never ever sue you.
464.68,466.84, If you've got a great funny line that's come
466.84,468.92," and just popped into your head,"
468.92,471.48," it's not quite right, but it's a great laugh."
471.48,472.28, What do you do?
472.28,473.88, You use it.
473.88,478.36," I use it, of course, because that's the rule one is to entertain."
478.36,480.12," And if the line is off the mark,"
480.12,481.72," then I'll use the next sentence to explain,"
481.72,483.08," well, it's not really quite true."
483.08,485.24," You know, you can always back off a joke, you know."
486.76,488.36, That's a nice thing about jokes incidentally.
488.36,490.28, You can't back off a serious statement.
490.28,492.44, The story will continue after this.
495.71999999999997,498.2," In his latest book, All the Trouble in the World,"
498.2,499.88," he goes after environmentalists,"
499.88,502.44," population planners, and others whom he calls"
502.44,504.92, professional warriors and winers.
504.92,506.84," Among other things, he hates repressed"
506.84,509.32," memory syndrome, multiculturalism,"
509.32,511.15999999999997," Berkeley, California, and Al Gore."
511.88,514.12," He's willing to offend almost everyone,"
514.12,515.88, even advocates for the handicap.
516.44,518.7600000000001," He calls them compassion fascists,"
518.7600000000001,521.08, and he says they've been at work building a ramp
521.08,524.12," at the post office in Peterborough, New Hampshire."
524.12,527.8000000000001," This wheelchair ramp in front of the post office,"
527.8000000000001,530.7600000000001, this was required by the Americans with Disabilities Act.
530.7600000000001,535.0, And this is a long and fairly steep and fairly narrow ramp.
535.6400000000001,538.0400000000001, I think basically you'd have to be a special
538.0400000000001,542.0400000000001, Olympics athlete to get your wheelchair up this thing.
542.0400000000001,544.2, A work says there's a more convenient ramp
544.2,546.2, at the post office's back door.
546.2,549.8000000000001, It's been there since the 1930s and his work just fine.
549.8000000000001,551.96," But according to the Americans with Disabilities Act,"
551.96,555.48, that's not good enough because that treats people with disabilities
555.48,557.72," differently than the rest of us are treated,"
557.72,559.8000000000001, and so there has to be a ramp in the front.
559.8000000000001,561.96, And the only thing it's used for is kids on skateboards.
562.6800000000001,564.6800000000001, The advocates would seem to have the law
564.6800000000001,567.32, and some would argue logic on their side.
567.88,570.5200000000001," Oh, you can have logic on your side, no problem."
570.5200000000001,573.4000000000001," What I'm saying is they don't have common sense on their side,"
573.4,575.56," and a lot of human life should be guided,"
575.56,578.36, most of human life should be guided by common sense
578.36,579.88, and not by legal quibbling.
580.6,582.4399999999999, That seems like a really hard approach.
582.4399999999999,585.8," I mean, to go after the Disabilities Act."
585.8,587.0, American Disabilities Act.
587.0,589.3199999999999," I mean, that seems like it's a hard-less"
589.3199999999999,591.64," position, totally devoid of humanity."
591.64,596.68, How could anybody possibly be against good things for the disabled?
596.68,599.96," How could anybody take such a rotten, awful position as that?"
599.96,602.52," Well, I can and it's for this reason."
602.6,607.3199999999999, Is that the purpose of this law was to make George Bush feel good
607.3199999999999,608.92, and to make Congress people feel good
608.92,610.92, and to a certain extent I suppose make voters feel good.
610.92,613.0799999999999, This ramp doesn't help anybody with disabilities.
613.0799999999999,614.52, There already was a ramp.
614.52,616.84, Nobody with disabilities is using this ramp.
616.84,617.96, This ramp is there.
617.96,623.0," It's a $100,000 monument to patting oneself upon the back."
624.12,625.96," Some of his friends, say, O'Rourke,"
625.96,628.6," is a lot more sophisticated than he lets on,"
628.6,631.0, that he writes for effect and for sales.
631.56,632.92, You really believe everything you write?
634.36,635.56," Oh, good question."
637.08,637.96, Of course not.
638.84,642.28," But I think that there's some root course,"
642.28,645.56, some seeds of kernel in there of something that I believe.
646.6,647.32, I'm humorous.
647.32,648.6, Do I exaggerate for effect?
648.6,650.52, Of course I exaggerate for effect.
650.52,653.24, Some people have said it and I know you've probably read it.
