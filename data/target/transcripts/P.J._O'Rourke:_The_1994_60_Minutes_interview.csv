0.0,4.64, 60 minutes rewind.
4.64,6.6000000000000005," Next subject, baby boomers."
6.6000000000000005,8.76, Let's begin with a trivia question.
8.76,11.52, Who is the most quoted living American in the Penguin
11.52,13.92, Dictionary of Humorous Quotations?
13.92,17.36," Woody Allen, Steve Martin, Johnny Carson,"
17.36,18.36, Ruhl.
18.36,19.16, Raw.
19.16,20.32, Here's a clue.
20.32,22.92, His last two books made it to the top of the New York Times
22.92,24.400000000000002, bestseller list.
24.400000000000002,26.16, Still don't know.
26.16,28.400000000000002, The answer is PJ O'Rourke.
28.4,33.199999999999996," You may never have heard of him, but if you're in your 30s or 40s or early 50s, believe me,"
33.199999999999996,34.199999999999996, you know him.
34.199999999999996,37.4, He's the guy on the leading edge of your generational curve.
37.4,39.12," And college, he was a hippie."
39.12,43.0," And while you were giggling at the National Ampune, he was the editor-in-chief."
43.0,46.72," Now that you're getting older and becoming more conservative, guess who's become the"
46.72,49.92, right-wing's favorite political satirist?
49.92,54.96, I am frankly nostalgic for the 1980s when sleeping with the president meant that you'd attended
54.96,55.96, a cabinet meeting.
56.800000000000004,62.8," Um, if you want to know why political incumbents are in trouble this year, spend some time on"
62.8,64.8, the road with PJ O'Rourke.
64.8,70.56," His suspicious, cynical takes on government find a friendly audience among small businessmen."
70.56,75.4," And his smart, often smart, alloky view of the world is struck a chord among his fellow"
75.4,79.44," jaded baby boomers, who crowd into bookstores for his readings."
79.44,82.16, I find your political observations so astute.
82.16,86.75999999999999, And have made his books like Parliament of Hors and give war a chance best sellers.
86.75999999999999,89.75999999999999, I am a liberal and I probably should hate everything you write.
89.75999999999999,91.75999999999999, And maybe it's because I'm an 18 liberal on this way.
91.75999999999999,97.16," I'm a conservative, but I find your law."
97.16,101.47999999999999," Like many in his audiences, he used to wear his hair long, smoked dope, and believe in"
101.47999999999999,103.28, free sex.
103.28,107.96," But as he's gotten older and more prosperous, he's become less of a libertine and more"
107.96,109.47999999999999, of a libertarian.
109.48,113.88000000000001, Which means he harbors a deep suspicion of government at all levels.
113.88000000000001,116.0, We've got two political parties in this country.
116.0,117.0, We've got the Democrats.
117.0,118.72, They're the party of government activism.
118.72,122.80000000000001," The party that says the government can make you richer, smarter, taller, take a dozen"
122.80000000000001,125.08, strokes off your golf game.
125.08,126.08000000000001, And they're the Republicans.
126.08000000000001,131.88, They're the party that says government doesn't work and then they get elected and proven.
131.88,135.8," O'Rourke was born in 1947, the height of the baby boom."
135.8,138.44," He grew up in suburban Toledo, Ohio."
138.44,140.28, His father was a Buick dealer.
140.28,143.72, It was a typical conservative Midwestern childhood.
143.72,148.60000000000002," And like many of his generation, in college, he underwent a temporary conversion to the"
148.60000000000002,149.76000000000002, counter culture.
149.76000000000002,152.84, He says now because he thought it would improve his social life.
152.84,154.24, You were a hippie.
154.24,155.76000000000002, You were a child of the 60s.
155.76000000000002,156.76000000000002, You were a hippie.
156.76000000000002,157.76000000000002, Yeah.
157.76000000000002,158.76000000000002, Yeah.
158.76000000000002,159.76000000000002, I was.
159.76000000000002,165.44," When it came to letting go of bourgeois proprieties, I let go with both hands."
165.44,169.35999999999999, It's definitely up to my neck and neck.
169.35999999999999,172.96, You tried all of the aspects of the life stuff.
172.96,173.96, Lots of drugs.
173.96,174.96, Lots of screaming about capitalism.
174.96,176.84," You know, lots of protesting against the war in Vietnam."
176.84,177.84, What you think about it was very self-serving.
177.84,180.0, And we're trying to send meat to the war in Vietnam.
180.0,182.12," I mean, so of course I was against it."
182.12,186.6," But sex drugs and rock and roll didn't stop O'Rourke from earning a degree, winning a"
186.6,192.28," scholarship to graduate school at Johns Hopkins, and starting an underground newspaper in Baltimore"
192.28,194.16, called Harry.
194.16,198.68," When he realized there was no future in the revolution, he headed off to New York City"
198.68,203.48," and the National Lampoon, where he quickly discovered that subversive humor fetched"
203.48,207.0, a far better paycheck than subversive politics.
207.0,212.76," By the time he was 31, O'Rourke was editor in chief of the lampoon, running a multi-million"
212.76,218.16," dollar enterprise turning out a slick, glossy monthly collection of sophomore and humor"
218.16,221.56," about breasts, buttocks, and ethnic attributes."
221.56,223.56, Read me about the Australians.
223.56,224.56, Yes.
224.56,229.44," Racial characteristics, violently loud, alcoholic rough necks, whose idea of fun is to throw"
229.44,230.44, up on your car.
230.44,231.44, Yeah.
231.44,233.16, Never go to Australia again.
233.16,234.76, You couldn't write this anymore.
234.76,235.76, Nah.
235.76,237.36, I'm all grown up.
237.36,241.36, The complete freedom from ever worrying about offending anybody.
241.36,245.48000000000002," I think there's probably the nicest thing about the National Lampoon, because if it ever"
245.48000000000002,251.2," crept into your mind that this might offend somebody, the natural and immediate response"
251.2,254.2," to the sustained lampooner was, yes."
254.2,257.03999999999996, That's a fabulous idea.
257.03999999999996,259.52, Let's do two of them.
259.52,260.84, Everything was a target.
260.84,261.84, Everything was a target.
261.84,266.76," God, we had, it was so much fun at the National Lampoon because it was truly an adolescent"
266.76,267.91999999999996, stream.
267.91999999999996,269.52, So then you went to work for Rolling Stone.
269.52,271.52," Then I went to work for Rolling Stone, right?"
271.52,275.28, I moved right up to a stairway of respectability.
276.28,281.0," Really solid old, respectable middle class, that's an institution."
281.0,282.4, Rolling Stone.
282.4,287.59999999999997," That was 13 years ago, and he's still there, using the same subversive sense of humor he"
287.59999999999997,291.84, developed at the Lampoon to report on serious events.
291.84,297.2," He's become the Rock Magazine's reactionary, combining the literary flair of Hunter Thompson"
297.2,301.03999999999996, with the ideology and habbitashery of George Will.
301.04,305.52000000000004," He holds the impressive title, Foreign Affairs Desk Chief, which he says looks great on"
305.52000000000004,306.92, the mast head.
306.92,313.36, But there is no Foreign Affairs Desk at Rolling Stone in O'Rourke never goes to the office.
313.36,317.6, Most of the time he operates out of the trunk of a rental car and some godforsaken part
317.6,323.56," of the world, nursing an inherently weak constitution with bottles of Pepto Bismol."
323.56,328.44," We caught up with him and his ever-present cigar last summer in Southern Mexico, where"
328.44,331.16, he was covering that country's national elections.
331.16,335.0," OK, they've got one political party that steals every election."
335.0,337.71999999999997, We've got two political parties that steal every election.
337.71999999999997,340.2, Now does that make us twice as good or twice as bad?
340.2,341.8, It definitely makes us similar.
341.8,346.28, O'Rourke's first rule of journalism stay away from people in power.
346.28,349.52, The reason is fundamentally that they lie.
349.52,350.6, They lie.
350.6,355.4, A highly placed government official did not get to be in a position of power and importance
355.4,359.52, by being stupid enough to tell the truth to the newspaper reporters.
359.52,363.08, Instead O'Rourke relies on observation and attitude.
363.08,369.0," He is the star of his own stories, the misadventures of an innocent abroad in strange lands."
369.0,374.76, Foreign correspondent loses his patience and his wallet.
374.76,380.96," What he does, he says, is take a very conventional middle-aged, midwestern sensibility to some very"
380.96,382.44, peculiar places.
382.44,387.88," From the fall of communism, a huge totalitarian system has been brought to its knees because"
387.88,391.0, nobody wants to wear Bulgarian shoes.
391.0,396.36," From the Gulf War, not only is this the first live televised war, it's also the first"
396.36,399.56, war covered by sober journalists.
399.56,405.28," When his home, P.J. O'Rourke leads a disciplined life, writing a steady 1,000 words a day."
405.28,410.92," He cultivates the literary persona of a cigar smoking, hard drinking, fast driving, womanizing"
410.92,414.52000000000004, martini guzzling slub.
414.52000000000004,420.0," But in fact, he lives in a New Hampshire farmhouse that could have been decorated by Martha Stewart."
420.0,424.84000000000003," In his life, there is almost bucolic, more barbecues than bar room brawls."
424.84000000000003,428.28000000000003, You never go away hungry and you never go away sober.
428.28000000000003,433.88," That persona, which was sort of developed at the National Ampune, was when I was 30, it"
433.88,435.20000000000005, was an exaggeration.
435.20000000000005,439.84000000000003," Now that I'm 47, it is what we technically call a lie."
439.84,443.28," I do drink, but that's probably about the end of it."
443.28,447.03999999999996, What's the difference between your persona and the real P.J. O'Rourke?
447.03999999999996,449.59999999999997," The persona is louder and dumber, you know, it's basically what I'm saying."
449.59999999999997,453.15999999999997, I use myself as a clown figure in the work.
453.15999999999997,456.76," It's nice to have somebody in the story that you know is not going to sue you, that you"
456.76,460.32, can say absolutely anything about it and you can make them do any foolish thing and have
460.32,464.91999999999996, any ridiculous opinion and they will never ever sue you.
464.91999999999996,469.32," If you've got a great funny line that's come and just popped into your head, it's not"
469.32,471.68," quite right, but it's a great laugh."
471.68,472.68, What do you do?
472.68,473.68, You use it.
473.68,479.59999999999997, I use it of course because that's the rule one is to entertain and if the line is off
479.59999999999997,483.15999999999997," the mark, then I'll use the next sentence to explain well, that's not really quite true."
483.15999999999997,486.96," You know, you can always back off a joke, you know."
486.96,488.4, That's a nice thing about jokes incidentally.
488.4,490.4, You can't back off a serious statement.
490.4,495.88, The story will continue after this.
495.88,500.6," In his latest book, All the Trouble in the World, he goes after environmentalist, population"
500.6,505.15999999999997, planners and others whom he calls professional warriors and winers.
505.15999999999997,510.44," Among other things, he hates repressed memory syndrome, multiculturalism, Berkeley, California"
510.44,512.16, and Al Gore.
512.16,516.48," He's willing to offend almost everyone, even advocates for the handicap."
516.48,521.2, He calls them compassion fascists and he says they've been at work building a ramp at
521.2,524.28," the post office in Peterborough, New Hampshire."
524.28,529.4399999999999," This wheelchair ramp in front of the post office, this was required by the Americans with"
529.4399999999999,535.56, Disabilities Act and this is a long and fairly steep and fairly narrow ramp.
535.56,540.9599999999999, I think basically you'd have to be a special Olympics athlete to get your wheelchair up
540.9599999999999,541.9599999999999, this thing.
541.9599999999999,546.36, A work says there's a more convenient ramp at the post office's back door.
546.36,550.0799999999999, It's been there since the 1930s and it's worked just fine.
550.08,553.62," According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, that's not good enough because that"
553.62,558.08, treats people with disabilities differently than the rest of us are treated and so there
558.08,560.0400000000001, has to be a ramp in the front.
560.0400000000001,562.84, And the only thing it's used for is kids on skateboards.
562.84,567.5200000000001, The advocates would seem to have the law and some would argue logic on their side.
567.5200000000001,570.24," Oh, you can have logic on your side, no problem."
570.24,575.08, What I'm saying is they don't have common sense on their side and a lot of human life should
575.08,580.84," be guided, most of human life should be guided by common sense and not by legal quibbling."
580.84,582.5600000000001, That seems like a really hard approach.
582.5600000000001,586.88," I mean, to go after the Disabilities Act, American Disabilities Act."
586.88,591.84," I mean, that seems like a hard-less, positioned, totally devoid of humanity."
591.84,596.88, How could anybody possibly be against good things for the disabled?
596.88,600.2," How could anybody take such a rotten, awful position as that?"
600.2,602.72," Well, I can and it's for this reason."
602.72,608.1600000000001, Is that the purpose of this law was to make George Bush feel good and to make Congress
608.1600000000001,611.12, people feel good and to a certain extent I suppose make voters feel good.
611.12,613.12, This ramp doesn't help anybody with disabilities.
613.12,614.6800000000001, There already was a ramp.
614.6800000000001,617.0400000000001, Nobody with disabilities is using this ramp.
617.0400000000001,618.0400000000001, This ramp is there.
618.0400000000001,624.4000000000001," It's a $100,000 monument to patting oneself upon the back."
624.4000000000001,628.84," Some of his friends, say O'Rourke, is a lot more sophisticated than he lets on."
628.84,631.72, He writes for effect and for sales.
631.72,633.76, You really believe everything you write?
633.76,635.84," Ooh, good question."
635.84,639.08, Of course not.
639.08,646.76," But I think that there's some root, some seeds of kernel in there of something that I believe."
646.76,647.76, I'm humorous.
647.76,648.76, Do I exaggerate for effect?
648.76,650.76, Of course I exaggerate for effect.
650.76,653.4000000000001, Some people have said it and I know you've probably read it.
653.4000000000001,656.84, P.J.'s very calculated.
656.84,661.6800000000001, Go back and look at him when he was writing for Harry and he was a hippie.
661.6800000000001,664.2800000000001, Then he turns up at the National Ampune as an editor.
664.2800000000001,668.64," Then he goes to work for Rolling Stone, a politically liberal publication."
668.64,674.6800000000001," And now when it's become fashionable to be conservative and right wing, what you're doing is becoming"
674.6800000000001,679.0400000000001, a conservative commentator that really you're an opportunist.
679.0400000000001,680.0400000000001, Definitely.
680.0400000000001,681.12," You know, there's no doubt about that."
681.12,684.1600000000001, I am a very ambitious person.
684.16,686.36, But I was a hippie when it was fun to be hippie.
686.36,689.6, It would have been very stupid to have been a hippie in the 50s.
689.6,692.28, And even stupider to be one in the 80s.
692.28,696.04," But the end of the 60s, beginning of the 70s, it was a great time to be a hippie."
696.04,698.0799999999999, But definitely I'm not an artist.
698.0799999999999,702.68, I'm a journalist and I like to get stuff published.
702.68,708.9599999999999, I like to make money and I like to get a lot of readers if I possibly can.
708.9599999999999,711.3199999999999," So, have I changed with the times?"
711.32,714.12," Well, God, what a strange person I would be if I hadn't."
