4.44,8.6," Madeline Albright has been on the job for a few weeks now, and Washington is already"
8.6,14.200000000000001, used to the idea of addressing the country's top diplomat as Madame Secretary.
14.200000000000001,18.52," But when we dropped in on the new Secretary of State last week, we found she's still"
18.52,20.52, getting used to the idea.
20.52,22.12, You're a pinch yourself.
22.12,23.12, Every morning.
23.12,27.52," You know, sometimes you wake up and you say, well, I just had a nice dream."
27.52,28.52, Do you think it's really true?
28.52,32.64," You know, and so it's a little bit like that."
32.64,38.92," Somebody said to me early on, do you realize that you have Thomas Jefferson's job and"
38.92,42.36, kind of a little awe there.
42.36,50.96," Yes, all this entire hall is filled with former Secretaries of State, and it gives you"
50.96,53.120000000000005, a great sense of history.
53.120000000000005,58.32, And I have to think that I'm now at the end of this line.
58.32,61.16, Do you want people to know about you?
61.16,63.56, I actually want them to know everything about me.
63.56,68.8, I am somebody who likes to have people know about me.
68.8,71.52, I am not a secretive person.
71.52,77.24000000000001," One thing about Albright that is no secret is that she came to America as a child, a refugee"
77.24000000000001,84.28," whose family fled Czechoslovakia twice, first from the Nazis, then from the communists."
84.28,88.52, But there were some things about her life that even Albright didn't know until just a
88.52,89.92, few days ago.
89.92,95.96000000000001," With the opening up of Czechoslovakia and with my naming as Secretary of State, there has"
95.96000000000001,102.68, been some very compelling information that the Washington Post found that my family was
102.68,111.08," indeed of Jewish origin, and that my grandparents may in fact have died in concentration camp."
111.08,112.56, And this was all unknown to you?
112.56,113.56, Totally.
113.56,125.12, I was raised Catholic and my parents were very political and saw the story as one or their
125.12,130.32, explanation to us was that they left for political reasons.
130.32,134.76, What Albright claims she just learned is that two and possibly three of her grandparents
134.76,139.08, were rounded up by the Nazis and taken to Auschwitz where they died.
139.08,144.04000000000002," At the time, Albright, her sister and parents were refugees in London."
144.04000000000002,148.44, Her parents never told her that they had converted to Catholicism in the thirties.
148.44,153.08, It only told her that her grandparents had died in the war.
153.08,158.16000000000003, This new chapter in her family history has come as a surprise to Albright who had been very
158.16000000000003,164.64000000000001," close to her parents, particularly her father, Joseph Corbell, a Czech diplomat who was serving"
164.64,169.95999999999998, at the United Nations in 1948 when the communists took over in Prague.
169.95999999999998,174.07999999999998, Were you very serious as a young girl?
174.07999999999998,175.07999999999998," Yes, I was."
175.07999999999998,177.07999999999998, I remember the war distinctly.
177.07999999999998,179.35999999999999, We were in London during the blitz.
179.35999999999999,184.95999999999998, I remember what it was like to come out of the air-aid shelter and see London bombed.
184.95999999999998,188.2, And then I was sent to school in Switzerland by myself when I was ten.
188.2,189.6, So I was pretty serious.
189.6,192.51999999999998, I think I was pretty boring in high school.
192.52,196.60000000000002, I was a foreign policy wonk even then.
196.60000000000002,199.16000000000003, Your sister says you're a lot more fun now.
199.16000000000003,200.16000000000003, I think I am.
200.16000000000003,201.28, I think I am.
201.28,202.8, I hope I am.
202.8,208.16000000000003," I know that fun for you is working hard, but you have to do something to get away from"
208.16000000000003,209.16000000000003, this.
209.16000000000003,216.76000000000002," I have a farm, not far from here, and nobody would ever recognize me on the farm as I"
216.76000000000002,222.28, play around in my garden barefooted and I go to the movies and I knit.
222.84,224.8, There's an awful lot to do.
224.8,226.12, You're having fun at it.
226.12,227.8," Yes, so far so good."
227.8,232.96," Young Madeline Corbell, as a new immigrant, tried to have fun too, but her father maintained"
232.96,235.88, a certain world outlook.
235.88,240.92000000000002," Believe it or not, my father used to follow me on dates."
240.92000000000002,248.02," He would let the poor boy drive me to the dance, follow us, and then insist that we be"
248.02,249.66, driven home.
249.66,255.58," And to this day, I will never forget the mortification when he's made me get into his car while my"
255.58,259.62, date followed me home and then invited this poor boy in for milk and cookies.
259.62,261.3, I didn't see that boy again.
261.3,262.3, And a chat with him?
262.3,264.3, Of that too.
264.3,269.22, Old Brite says she tried to be less protective when raising her three daughters.
269.22,272.90000000000003, They were there in the Oval Office last month holding the family Bible.
272.90000000000003,277.38," When Old Brite was sworn in as Secretary of State, a senior cabinet member, and the"
277.38,279.3, country's top diplomat.
279.3,280.3," So help me, God."
280.3,281.54," So help me, God."
281.54,285.38," Congratulations, Madam Secretary."
285.38,290.62," In her new job, Madeline Allbright is moving straight ahead in Washington's fast lane."
290.62,295.18, But she's been in the public eye for the last four years when she served as ambassador
295.18,297.34, to the United Nations.
297.34,300.74, There she stood out from the Penn Stry Proud.
300.74,307.1, How many times have you seen the Macarena at the Security Council?
307.1,311.46000000000004, You certainly weren't the typical diplomatic at the United Nations.
311.46000000000004,314.26000000000005, You were known for being outspoken.
314.26000000000005,318.5, Some even said that you were times undiplomatic.
318.5,322.42, Is that just the way you are or was that a deliberate tactic?
322.42,327.82000000000005," Well, first of all, I truly do believe it's important to say what you think."
327.82000000000005,332.58000000000004, And Old Brite often did exactly that in the usually stuffy confines of the U.S.
332.58000000000004,334.18, She told off the French.
334.18,340.86, The comments by the French Defense Minister are very ill-informed and counterproductive.
340.86,343.26, She warned Saddam Hussein.
343.26,349.78000000000003, Let it be absolutely clear to the Iraqi government that a repetition of its past mistakes will
349.78000000000003,354.66, be met by my government with the same resolve as before.
354.66,357.42, She threatened Haiti's military leaders.
357.42,364.02, You can depart voluntarily and soon or you can depart involuntarily and soon.
364.02,369.58, And she used an undiplomatic Spanish word to express her contempt for the way Cuban fighter
369.58,375.53999999999996, pilots boasted about shooting down two unarmed American civilian planes last year.
375.53999999999996,379.34," Frankly, this is not Cahone's."
379.34,381.09999999999997, This is cowardice.
381.09999999999997,385.85999999999996," Her boss, President Clinton, called that the best one-liner in his administration's foreign"
385.85999999999996,387.34, policy.
387.34,391.26, And it reflected something else that's different about Madeline Albright.
391.26,397.42," She's willing, her critics say, to willing, to send American troops into foreign conflicts."
397.42,404.18," She backed using American military force in Haiti, in Somalia, in Rwanda, and in Bosnia."
404.18,411.38," Rather than feeling that it is wrong to interfere, I always believe that if you can stop something"
411.38,419.06, early and you can show the support of free countries for those who are under totalitarianism
419.06,421.7," and it's worth doing, that's my mindset."
421.7,426.82, There are a lot of people who would read that as you're willing to put American military
426.82,428.82, men and women in harm's way.
428.82,437.86, The ability of America to marry force and diplomacy is something that is very important to the
437.86,439.86, maintenance of our values.
439.86,446.9," And I think that we have to be very, very selective when we think about using our military, but"
446.9,449.65999999999997, we can't be afraid to.
449.65999999999997,452.53999999999996, Diplomacy was not in her career plan in college.
452.53999999999996,457.26, She covered politics for the student newspaper and wanted to become a journalist.
457.26,463.73999999999995," Three days after graduation in 1959, she married Joseph Albright, a reporter and heir to a newspaper"
463.73999999999995,464.9, fortune.
464.9,467.7, But his job stood in her way.
467.7,473.73999999999995," One of my husband's editors actually said to me, honey, you may want to be a reporter,"
473.74,479.46000000000004, but you can't be on a competing paper and you can't be on the paper that your husband
479.46000000000004,481.82," works on, so why don't you find another career?"
481.82,482.82, And I did.
482.82,483.82, And I didn't fight it.
483.82,485.22, So you could have been a journalist?
485.22,486.22, I could have.
486.22,488.06, Could have ended up covering the State Department?
488.06,491.26," Well, I could have and I could have asked Nasty questions."
491.26,496.98, Do you get peved at all when people focus on appearance rather than substance?
496.98,502.58," What it is noted, what I have on, or whether I'm going to have a facelift, I think that"
502.58,504.5, I get to be down.
504.5,509.02," I haven't had a facelift, by the way."
509.02,514.54, The story will continue after this.
514.54,520.5," Albright had her first children, twins in 1961, but she was determined to have a career"
520.5,521.66, as well.
521.66,524.78, She went to graduate school and got involved in politics.
524.78,530.38," She worked on Capitol Hill for then-Senator Ed Muske, and then moved to the Carter White"
530.38,533.3, House as an aide to the National Security Council.
533.3,537.98," When you went to work for Senator Muske, your first paying job, your 39 years old, you"
537.98,540.34, must have felt you had a lot of catching up to do.
540.34,541.34, Did you ever plan?
541.34,542.34, I never had a plan.
542.34,550.86, And I've said this to a lot of young women is that the only plan I ever had was to try
550.86,556.26," to use the knowledge that I had, work hard and have a good time."
556.26,558.1, My version of good time.
558.1,559.1, Which is?
559.1,563.22, To work hard and make a difference.
563.22,565.1800000000001," Is Hokey, is that my sound?"
565.1800000000001,571.7," If Albright's professional life had a Hokey storybook quality, not so her personal life,"
571.7,575.74, what would you say was the greatest setback in your life?
575.74,583.5," Well, a diversion from plan, I must say, was my divorce, probably, in that I had not"
583.5,584.5, expected that.
584.5,591.34, And I had expected to continue in what I was doing and live happily ever after.
591.34,592.34, You didn't see it coming?
592.34,594.18, I certainly did not.
594.18,598.18, Did that change you in some way?
598.18,599.38, Did you become more determined?
599.38,601.46, Did you feel you had something to prove?
601.46,604.22," No, I think it made me more self-reliant, though."
604.22,611.26," I think if it taught me anything, it was to rely on my own judgment and to do what I"
611.26,615.38, needed to do for my daughters and for myself.
615.38,620.58," After the breakup of her 23-year marriage, Albright got a job teaching international relations"
620.58,623.22, at Georgetown University in Washington.
623.22,627.1, But she tried to teach the women in her classes something else.
627.1,635.7," To interrupt, I found that as a woman kind of working my way up in the government was"
635.7,641.62, that women often wait too long in meetings to make their views known.
641.62,646.3000000000001, And then all of a sudden some man says whatever it is that you were going to say and everybody
646.3000000000001,647.94, thinks it's brilliant.
647.94,653.1400000000001, So I basically taught people never to raise their hands and interrupt.
653.1400000000001,655.3000000000001, And I think that that's what women need to do.
