10.540000000000001,15.96," reek in controversy. To many, China is a problematic host, given the country's"
15.96,21.0, human rights abuses and hard authoritarian turn. One of the loudest voices
21.0,26.560000000000002," condemning China is not a voice at all, but rather a hand. Since self-exiling"
26.56,32.04," from China in 2009, the artist known simply as Body It's Owl has used his work"
32.04,36.44, to take on the country's leader Xi Jinping specifically and the regime more
36.44,40.879999999999995," generally. Like all the best political cartoonists, Body It's Owl is"
40.879999999999995,45.92, alternately angry and playful as he calls attention to what he sees as China's
45.92,52.04," brutality. It's common as steep price. Body It's Owl may never go home again, but"
52.04,58.16, on he goes traveling the world using paint and wit online and on walls to draw
58.16,68.36, truth to power. The story will continue in a moment. Had you been in Miami Beach
68.36,72.75999999999999," this fall, you'd be forgiven for walking by this plaza in thinking you'd"
72.75999999999999,77.28, encountered promotional billboards for the Beijing Winter Olympics. But a
77.28,83.32000000000001, closer look revealed a provocative visual argument for why China is unfit to
83.32000000000001,86.64," host the games. Here was a Chinese hockey player,"
86.64,91.72," bloodying a Tibetan monk, a Chinese snowboarder atop a surveillance camera, a"
91.72,96.72, faceless Chinese biathlete poised to execute a member of the weaker minority.
96.72,102.92, A curler representing China's delay in warning the world about COVID. This was
102.92,108.36," the handy work of Body It's Owl, a 35-year-old Chinese exile now based in"
108.36,112.34," Australia. I noticed if you look closely, those aren't conventional Olympic"
112.34,118.16, rings. They're actually made of Bob Dwyer. That's exactly how China is going to
118.16,124.92," use Olympics not as a celebration for humanity, but actually use it as a"
124.92,130.24," platform to promoting its propaganda, which is fundamentally cracking down"
130.24,136.04000000000002, on people's basic rights. Body It's Owl had come to South Florida to accept the
136.04000000000002,141.08," human rights foundations, but soft-hovel prize for creative descent. What do you"
141.08,147.68," see as the purpose of your art? I sometimes just imagine I'm this kid, he's holding a"
147.68,152.20000000000002," big rock, and just throw the rock into the lake. So that we see all the splash,"
152.20000000000002,156.36," we see the change. You throw your rock in this lake, see the splash, see where the"
156.36,164.08, ripples ripple. Exactly. China does not tolerate ripples. Inside China there are
164.08,168.68," strict laws forbidding mocking and questioning leaders of the Communist Party,"
168.68,174.96," known as the CCP. Even outside China, descent does not go over well. Do you feel"
174.96,181.12," in danger? Do you feel unsafe? Well, this is actually my daily routine that I"
181.12,185.48000000000002," would receive death threats in a daily based online on my social media Twitter,"
185.48,191.23999999999998," Instagram, direct message. Body It's Ow knows that as an artist poking the"
191.23999999999998,196.83999999999997," Chinese regime, he risks retaliation, both against himself and his family back in"
196.83999999999997,201.76," China. For years, he hid behind a mask in public, working in Cognito,"
201.76,207.39999999999998," guerrilla style, both in Australia and anytime he traveled. He adopted a pseudonym"
207.39999999999998,213.0," as Body It's Owl, the name that purposely he says has no meaning. How many people"
213.0,217.8," know your real name? If you know I'm Body It's Owl, then you don't know my real name,"
217.8,222.4," and if you know my real name, then you don't know I'm Body It's Owl. When the Chinese"
222.4,227.08," figured out his real identity three years ago, Body It's Owl initially went"
227.08,232.2," underground, but he took off his mask and has continued hurling darts at the regime."
232.2,238.36," In this recent cartoon, Tennis Star Pung Shui confronts the reality of accusing a"
238.36,244.28," former vice premier of sexual assault. I want to be an inspiring figure, I want"
244.28,251.12," my arts to helping others to collecting courage and join me, but if I giving up"
251.12,256.68," this, then what does it say to the rest of them? What is the relationship between"
256.68,262.76, your popularity and your security? I do think it has a very close relationship.
262.76,267.64," So almost the more popular you get, you're buying yourself an extra layer of security."
268.12,274.59999999999997," Yeah, and that's the only way that you can do it. Maybe so, but being popular also means"
274.59999999999997,280.76, his work has been scrubbed by sensors inside China. What is it about your work that drives
280.76,287.88," this regime crazy? I guess it's this attitude that I don't care about how serious you are,"
287.88,294.2, how dangerous you are. I'm just going to be myself. I am an individual. I'm not controlled by
294.2,301.47999999999996, any authority. Certainly not CCP. That scares them because all they want is total control.
301.47999999999996,307.24," It sounds like you know exactly what buttons to push, but what levers to pull on that's going to"
307.24,312.59999999999997, tweak them. I guess it's not me finding the button. It's them offering the button to me.
313.64,320.03999999999996," One example among many, an internet meme surfaced comparing Xi Jinping and Barack Obama to Winnie the"
320.04,326.6," Pooh and Tigger. No big deal, right? China censored any mention or image linking Xi to Pooh."
327.32,332.20000000000005," To Buddy et Sao, this was irresistible. He created a series of cartoons,"
332.20000000000005,336.6, poking fun at Xi's hard-line stance against an animated Disney character.
337.0,342.12, What was it about Winnie the Pooh? Why was that so effective? Because Winnie the Pooh is so
342.12,349.0," loved by public. It's so recognized. When it's combined with Xi Jinping's image,"
349.0,354.44, then people ask questions. Why do you want to delete that yellow bear? You recognize the absurdity
354.44,363.32, of this towering superpower being so offended by benign yellow bear. Exactly. If you're in the
363.32,369.8," Democrat society, I think position will be thrilled if they can compare with Winnie the Pooh instead"
369.8,377.0," of some evil character. But we're talking about China. When she was reelected by China's Parliament,"
377.0,385.48," the margin was 2,970 votes to zero. And when Xi got rid of term limits,"
385.48,391.08," allowing him to rule indefinitely, Buddy et Sao posted this tongue-in-cheek creation online,"
391.08,397.16," he called Xi forever. When the Communist Party went to work on passing a resolution,"
397.16,403.0," favorably equating Xi to the dictator Mao Zedong, Buddy et Sao, armed with posters,"
403.0,409.88," homey glue in a full satchel of outrage, went to work in Manhattan. He compared Xi to a magician"
409.88,416.68," conjuring Chairman Mao's spirit. Xi Jinping has tried to portray himself as another Mao Zedong,"
416.68,422.6, another red son of China. He won't achieve what Mao has achieved. He won't be celebrated as
422.6,430.04," this god-like figure, like Mao enjoyed in his time. It was by accident that Buddy et Sao"
430.04,436.20000000000005," became a leading critic of the Chinese Communist Party. In 2007, he was a law student in his hometown"
436.20000000000005,441.56," of Shanghai, watching a film online when the movie abruptly switched to footage somewhere"
441.56,446.68," had secretly embedded, depicting the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square."
449.88,458.12," And that is actually the very first time I know this exists. So wait, so you're in law school,"
458.2,462.28000000000003, you're in your 20s. I am. In the first time you're hearing about the Tiananmen Square
462.28000000000003,466.36," massacres worldwide news, and the first time you're hearing about it is when randomly"
466.36,472.44," yeah it's in a documentary you happen to see. Yeah thanks to some clever,"
473.72,480.04, dissident who made this happen. Your parents haven't told you about this? Never. Teachers? Never.
480.20000000000005,486.6, Discovering the truth about Tiananmen Square made Buddy et Sao want to leave China.
489.8,494.04," It wasn't just what had happened, it was how easily the history was erased."
494.68,502.04," In 2009, he resettled to Australia, gave up law and started drawing, despite no formal training."
502.04,507.16," He eventually branched out, traveling in performing street art to highlight China's repression."
507.8,512.12," In these scenes from the Australian documentary China's artful dissident,"
512.12,516.52," Buddy et Sao, still masked, posed in front of Berlin's Brandon Bergate."
517.08,520.36," He was honoring one of the most taboo subjects in China,"
520.9200000000001,527.88," Tankman, the nameless pro-democracy protestor who stood in front of the Chinese military in 1989."
528.6800000000001,534.36, Tankman is the ghost haunting CCP the most. What does Tankman represent?
535.0,543.32, It shows that any ordinary people or person could have the courage to stand in front of the most
543.32,551.64, powerful object. I know the image of Tankman is always near you. Before the 25th anniversary of
551.64,556.52," Tiananmen Massacre, I just want something on my right arm, the arm that I used to draw,"
556.52,563.5600000000001, as a reminder that this ordinary Chinese guy who just collect all the courage in the world
564.52,568.68, and push himself in front of a tank is fearless.
569.64,575.8," While in the US, Buddy et Sao connected with students who marched for democracy in Tiananmen Square."
575.8,582.68," They're now middle-aged, exiled, and still bear scars. Fang Zheng lost his legs to a tank during"
582.68,588.76, the massacre. Zhou Feng Suo was among the first to enter Tiananmen Square and one of the last to
589.72,593.48, the former student C. Buddy et Sao keeping alive their ideals.
593.48,602.4399999999999," It's important for the next generation to carry the torch on. I see this hope on him,"
603.0,608.68, and he's so creative. That's how you feel. He's carrying the torch for what your generation started.
608.68,615.4," Yes, definitely. As a protest leader, Zhou became the fifth most-wanted man in China."
615.4,619.48," He spent a year in jail, then fled to the US in the mid-90s."
619.48,623.3199999999999, Zhou's China doesn't know how to handle Buddy et Sao.
623.3199999999999,629.9599999999999," Chinese influence over the world is so cohesive and they can control anything, for example,"
629.9599999999999,634.4399999999999," you know, US companies, but still they cannot change Buddy et Sao."
634.4399999999999,643.48, This one single person who can always come up with endless arts challenging the authority.
643.48,648.12," I think the Chinese Communist Party can pressure companies and other nations,"
648.84,653.72," but they can't. They can't change this guy. Yeah, that's the spirit of Tiananmen."
653.72,659.32, The person or his totalitarian nation. He's definitely a thong in their eye.
660.76,665.32," Buddy et Sao may be alone dissonant, taking on the world's largest government,"
665.32,672.52, but he is convinced his is no exercise and futility. He said you admire the mythological figure
672.52,679.0799999999999, of the CCP. Right. What do you mean by that? His mission seems like doomed that he will never
679.0799999999999,687.24, push the rock to the very top of the mountain. It's a bit like me when I'm creating artworks
687.24,693.16," to challenge Chinese regime. I don't know when it will be changed, or I don't know if my work"
693.16,701.96," will change it at all. But even if that is a reality, does it mean my work has no meaning?"
701.96,707.96," I don't think so. In September, Buddy et Sao brought out his paintbrush to convey his outrage"
707.96,714.2800000000001," for China's crackdown on Hong Kong. Fashioning Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam as a puppet of Xi Jinping,"
714.2800000000001,720.36," Buddy et Sao melded their faces. Last month in Northern Italy, a center of art,"
720.36,725.96, that combined image greeted visitors as Buddy et Sao held his first major solo exhibition in the
725.96,731.48," city of Brescia. It almost didn't happen. At the last minute, China tried to flex its muscle."
742.52,747.96," Specifically, the Chinese Embassy in Rome demanded the show be cancelled because the exhibition"
747.96,754.2," was full of anti-Chinese lies. Would seriously wound the feelings of the Chinese people,"
754.76,761.08, and posed a threat to friendly relations between China and Italy. The Italian authorities held
761.08,767.6400000000001," firm, and the show went on. There was a nod to what Buddy et Sao sees that Xi's willfully slow"
767.6400000000001,773.24," response to COVID, and he paid homage to the weaker minority that China has imprisoned."
774.12,778.6800000000001, To what extent are you representing the people who can't express themselves inside China?
778.76,786.8399999999999, I think this is the reality that Chinese people do not have a sense of safety that they can speak
786.8399999999999,794.4399999999999," freely, but I am in this very privileged position that I'm not in China. So I have every responsibility"
795.0,803.64," to make my voice to be heard, to become their voices."
