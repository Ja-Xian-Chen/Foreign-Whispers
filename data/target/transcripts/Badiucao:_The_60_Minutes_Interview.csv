10.46,15.88," wreath in controversy. To many, China is a problematic host, given the country's"
15.88,20.92, human rights abuses and hard authoritarian turn. One of the loudest voices
20.92,26.48," condemning China is not a voice at all, but rather a hand. Since self-exiling"
26.48,32.0," from China in 2009, the artist known simply as Body It's Owl has used his work"
32.0,36.4, to take on the country's leader Xi Jinping specifically and the regime more
36.4,40.84," generally. Like all the best political cartoonists, Body It's Owl is"
40.84,45.88, alternately angry and playful as he calls attention to what he sees as China's
45.88,52.0," brutality. It's common as steep price. Body It's Owl may never go home again, but"
52.0,58.12, on he goes traveling the world using paint and wit online and on walls to draw
58.12,68.32, truth to power. The story will continue in a moment. Had you been in Miami Beach
68.32,72.72," this fall, you'd be forgiven for walking by this plaza in thinking you'd"
72.72,77.24000000000001, encountered promotional billboards for the Beijing Winter Olympics. But a
77.24,83.28, closer look revealed a provocative visual argument for why China is unfit to
83.28,86.6," host the games. Here was a Chinese hockey player,"
86.6,91.67999999999999," bloodying a Tibetan monk, a Chinese snowboarder, a top of surveillance camera, a"
91.67999999999999,96.67999999999999, faceless Chinese biathlete poised to execute a member of the weaker minority.
96.67999999999999,102.88, A curler representing China's delay in warning the world about COVID. This was
102.88,108.32," the handy work of Body It's Owl, a 35-year-old Chinese exile now based in"
108.32,112.3," Australia. I noticed if you look closely, those aren't conventional Olympic"
112.3,118.39999999999999, rings. They're actually made of Bob Dwyer. That's exactly how China is going to use
118.39999999999999,126.03999999999999," Olympics not as a celebration for humanity, but actually use it as a platform to"
126.03999999999999,131.12," promoting its propaganda, which is fundamentally cracking down people's"
131.12,136.32, basic rights. Body It's Owl had come to South Florida to accept the human
136.32,141.52," rights foundations, Votswav Havl Prize for creative descent. What do you see as"
141.52,147.88," the purpose of your art? I sometimes just imagine I'm this kid, he's holding a big"
147.88,152.76," rock, and just throw the rock into the lake so that we see all the splashes, we"
152.76,156.32," see the change. You throw your rock in this lake, see the splash, see where the"
156.32,164.04, ripples ripple. Exactly. China does not tolerate ripples. Inside China there are
164.04,168.64," strict laws forbidding mocking and questioning leaders of the Communist Party,"
168.64,174.92," known as the CCP. Even outside China, descent does not go over well. Do you feel"
174.92,181.07999999999998," in danger? Do you feel unsafe? Well, this is actually my daily routine that I"
181.07999999999998,185.44," would receive death threats in a daily based online on my social media Twitter,"
185.44,191.2," Instagram, direct message. Body It's Owl knows that as an artist poking the"
191.2,196.8," Chinese regime, he risks retaliation, both against himself and his family back in"
196.8,201.76," China. For years, he hid behind a mask in public, working in Cognito,"
201.76,206.9," guerrilla style, both in Australia and anytime he traveled. He adopted a"
206.9,212.68," pseudonym, Spadiet's Owl, a name that purposely he says has no meaning. How many"
212.68,217.28," people know your real name? If you know I'm body of style, then you don't know my"
217.28,221.88," real name. And if you know my real name, then you don't know I'm body of style. When"
221.88,226.76000000000002," the Chinese figured out his real identity three years ago, body of style initially"
226.76000000000002,231.8," went underground, but he took off his mask and has continued hurling darts at the"
231.8,237.68," regime. In this recent cartoon, tennis star Pung Shui confronts the reality of"
237.68,243.5, accusing a former vice premier of sexual assault. I want to be an inspiring
243.5,249.92000000000002, figure. I want my arts to helping others to collecting courage and join me. But
249.92000000000002,255.8," if I giving up this, then what does it say to the rest of them? What is the"
255.8,260.96000000000004, relationship between your popularity and your security? I do think it has a very
260.96000000000004,266.54," close relationship. So almost the more popular you get, you're buying yourself an"
266.54,272.06," extra layer of security. Yeah, and that's the only way that you can do it. Maybe"
272.06,277.46000000000004," so, but being popular also means his work has been scrubbed by sensors inside"
277.46000000000004,282.86, China. What is it about your work that drives this regime crazy? I guess it's
282.86,289.46000000000004," this attitude that I don't care about how serious you are, how dangerous you are. I'm"
289.46000000000004,294.40000000000003, just going to be myself. I am an individual. I'm not controlled by any
294.4,300.2, else. I already certainly not CCP. That scares them because all they want is
300.2,305.59999999999997," total control. It sounds like you know exactly what buttons to push, but what"
305.59999999999997,310.28, levers to pull on that's going to tweak them. I guess it's not me finding the
310.28,315.96, button. It's them offering the button to me. One example among many in Internet
315.96,320.44, meme surfaced comparing Xi Jinping and Barack Obama to Winnie the Pooh in
320.44,326.56," Tigger. No big deal, right? China censored any mention or image linking Xi to Pooh."
326.56,332.56," To Buddy at Cao, this was irresistible. He created a series of cartoons poking"
332.56,337.8, fun at Xi's hardline stance against an animated Disney character. What was it
337.8,342.04, about winning the Pooh? Why was that so effective? Because Winnie Pooh is so
342.04,348.0, loved by public. It's so recognized. And when it's combined with Xi Jinping's
348.0,352.88," image, then people ask questions, why do you want to delete that yellow bear?"
352.88,357.92, You recognize the absurdity of this towering superpower being so offended by
357.92,365.48," the benign yellow bear. Exactly. If you're in the Democrat society, I think"
365.48,369.96, position will be thrilled if they can compare with Winnie the Pooh instead of
369.96,375.92, some evil character. But we're talking about China. When she was reelected by
375.92,384.52000000000004," China's parliament, the margin was 2,970 votes to zero. And when Xi got rid of"
384.52000000000004,389.64000000000004," term limits, allowing him to rule indefinitely, Buddy at Cao posted this tongue"
389.64000000000004,395.04, and chi creation online. He called Xi forever. When the Communist Party went to
395.04,399.92," work on passing a resolution, favorably equating Xi to the dictator Mao Zedong,"
399.92,406.36," Buddy at Cao armed with posters, homey glue, and a full satchel of outrage went to"
406.36,411.68, work in Manhattan. He compared Xi to a magician conjuring Chairman Mao's spirit.
411.68,417.28000000000003," Xi Jinping has tried to portray himself as another Mao Zedong, another red"
417.28000000000003,421.48, son of China. He won't achieve what Mao has achieved. He won't be
421.48,428.56," celebrated as this godlike figure, like Mao enjoyed in his time. It was by"
428.56,432.56, accident that Buddy at Cao became a leading critic of the Chinese Communist Party.
432.56,437.88," In 2007, he was a law student in his hometown of Shanghai, watching a film"
437.88,442.24, online when the movie abruptly switched to footage somewhere he'd secretly
442.24,446.68," embedded, depicting the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square."
446.68,457.28," And that is actually the very first time I know this exists. So wait, so you're in"
457.28,461.35999999999996, law school? You're in your 20s. I am. And the first time you're hearing about
461.35999999999996,464.67999999999995," the Tiananmen Square massacres worldwide news, and the first time you're hearing"
464.67999999999995,469.11999999999995, about it is when randomly it's in a documentary you happen to see.
469.11999999999995,475.91999999999996," Yeah, thanks to some clever, dissident who made this happen."
475.91999999999996,480.76, Your parents haven't told you about this? Never. Teachers? Never.
480.76,486.15999999999997, Discovering the truth about Tiananmen Square made Buddy at Cao want to leave
486.16,494.16, China. It wasn't just what had happened. It was how easily the history was erased.
494.16,501.6," In 2009, he resettled to Australia, gave up law and started drawing, despite no formal training."
501.6,507.20000000000005," He eventually branched out, traveling and performing street art to highlight China's repression."
507.20000000000005,511.84000000000003," In these scenes from the Australian documentary China's artful dissident,"
512.0799999999999,517.52," body itself, still masked, posed in front of Berlin's Brandon Bergate. He was"
517.52,523.6," honoring one of the most taboo subjects in China, Tankman, the nameless pro-democracy"
523.6,528.72, protester who stood in front of the Chinese military in 1989.
528.72,535.04, Tankman is the ghost haunting CCP the most. What does Tankman represent?
535.04,542.88, It shows that any ordinary people or person could have the courage to stand in front of the
542.88,548.48, most powerful object. I know the image of Tankman is always near you.
549.28,554.8," Before the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Massacre, I just want something on my right arm,"
554.8,562.24, the arm that I used to draw as a reminder that this ordinary Chinese guy who just collect
562.24,568.64, all the courage in the world and push himself in front of Tank is fearless.
569.6,575.76," While in the US, body itself connected with students who marched for democracy in Tiananmen Square."
575.76,582.64," They're now middle-aged, exiled, and still bear scars. Fang Zheng lost his legs to a tank during"
582.64,589.04, the massacre. Zhou Feng Suo was among the first to enter Tiananmen Square and one of the last to leave.
589.76,593.4399999999999, The former student C. Body itself keeping alive their ideals.
593.4399999999999,598.56, It's important for the next generation to carry the torch on.
599.1999999999999,604.9599999999999, And I see this hope on him and he's so creative.
604.9599999999999,608.64, That's how you feel. He's carrying the torch for what your generation started.
608.64,609.92," Yes, definitely."
610.9599999999999,615.28," As a protest leader, Zhou became the fifth most wanted man in China."
615.36,619.4399999999999, He spent a year in jail then fled to the US in the mid-90s.
619.4399999999999,623.1999999999999, Zhou says China doesn't know how to handle body itself.
623.1999999999999,629.92," Chinese influence over the world is so cohesive and they can control anything, for example,"
629.92,634.4," you know, US companies. But still, they cannot change body itself."
634.4,643.4399999999999, This one single person who can always come out with endless arts challenging the authority.
643.44,648.08," I think the Chinese Communist Party can pressure companies and other nations,"
648.6400000000001,651.36, but they can't. They can't change this guy.
651.36,653.6800000000001," Yeah, that's the spirit of Tiananmen."
653.6800000000001,659.2800000000001, The person is a totalitarian nation. He's definitely a thong in their eye.
660.72,665.2800000000001," Body itself may be alone dissonant, taking on the world's largest government."
665.2800000000001,668.72, But he is convinced his is no exercise and futility.
669.2800000000001,673.2800000000001, He said you admire the mythological figure cicitis.
673.28,675.1999999999999, Right. What do you mean by that?
675.1999999999999,681.1999999999999, His mission seems like doomed that he will never push the rock to the very top of the mountain.
683.6,688.64, It's a bit like me when I'm creating artworks to challenge Chinese regime.
689.4399999999999,694.24, I don't know when it will be changed or I don't know if my work would change it at all.
696.4,701.92," But even if that is a reality, does it mean my work has no meaning?"
702.0,702.8, I don't think so.
703.8399999999999,708.64," In September, body itself brought out his paintbrush to convey his outrage for China's"
708.64,714.24," crackdown on Hong Kong. Fashioning Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, is a puppet of Xi Jinping."
714.24,716.0799999999999, Body itself melded their faces.
717.36,722.88," Last month in Northern Italy, a center of art, that combined image greeted visitors as body"
722.88,728.64, itself held his first major solo exhibition in the city of Brescia. It almost didn't happen.
728.72,731.68," At the last minute, China tried to flex its muscle."
731.68,735.6, They actually writing threatening letters. It's like a blackmailing.
736.4,741.52," If you do body tells show that maybe in the future, our collaboration will be problematic."
742.48,747.92," Specifically, the Chinese Embassy in Rome demanded the show be cancelled because the exhibition"
747.92,754.08, was full of anti-Chinese lies. Would seriously wound the feelings of the Chinese people
754.72,761.0400000000001, and posed a threat to friendly relations between China and Italy. The Italian authorities held
761.0400000000001,767.6, firm and the show went on. There was a nod to what body itself sees that Xi's willfully slow
767.6,773.2, response to COVID. And he paid homage to the weaker minority that China has imprisoned.
774.08,778.6400000000001, To what extent are you representing the people who can't express themselves inside China?
778.72,786.8, I think this is the reality that Chinese people do not have a sense of safety that they can speak
786.8,794.4, freely. But I am in this very privileged position that I'm not in China. So I have every responsibility
794.96,803.6," to make my voice to be heard, to become their voices."
