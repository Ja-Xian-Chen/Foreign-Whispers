0.0,6.96, A story about someone named Reality Winner has to start with the name.
6.96,13.56," Her father, playing on the family name, explained he wanted a real winner, and so reality."
13.56,20.18," Maybe that still doesn't make sense, but it is the least baffling fact in this story."
20.18,26.44, Reality Winner became an infamous name in 2017 when she was accused of espionage.
26.44,31.36, She was hit with the longest sentence ever imposed on a civilian for leaking classified
31.36,33.6, information to the media.
33.6,37.04," Now released, she spoke with us."
37.04,43.980000000000004," Did Reality Winner do exceptionally grave damage, as the prosecutor said, or did she reveal"
43.980000000000004,47.72, a truth that defended America?
47.72,53.760000000000005," It's complicated, like the young woman with the unforgettable name."
53.76,59.16, The story will continue in a moment.
59.16,61.839999999999996, I am not a traitor.
61.839999999999996,65.92, I am not a spy.
65.92,73.56, I am somebody who only acted out of love for what this country stands for.
73.56,74.84, Nobody ever really appreciated it.
74.84,81.96, We met 30-year-old reality winner at home in Texas after four years behind bars.
81.96,88.28, Espionage seems surprising for a woman who joined the Air Force at 19 and won the Air Force
88.28,95.83999999999999," Commandation Medal in 2016 for, quote, 600 enemies killed in action."
95.83999999999999,101.96, She did that as a linguist in a combat unit fighting secret missions.
101.96,103.96, How many languages do you speak?
103.96,106.39999999999999," Farsi, Dari, and Pashdo."
106.39999999999999,110.75999999999999, These are the languages of Afghanistan and Iran.
110.76,112.28, Yes.
112.28,118.72," But her duty station was 7,000 miles away from those countries at Fort Mead, Maryland."
118.72,120.36, Why are you at Fort Mead?
120.36,121.36, Not.
121.36,123.56, Am I allowed to say that?
123.56,124.56, Nope.
124.56,125.56, Nope.
125.56,130.64000000000001, That's the voice of her lawyer who helped her steer clear of secrets in our interview.
130.64000000000001,137.04000000000002," Winner wouldn't say it, but at Fort Mead, linguists, eavesdropped on communications in"
137.04,141.64, Afghanistan to identify targets for armed drones.
141.64,144.79999999999998, It is not something I am allowed to discuss.
144.79999999999998,148.68," She didn't discuss her mission with her mother, Billy Winner Davis."
148.68,156.23999999999998," Only one conversation that I had with her, did she ever let on how heavy her work was."
156.23999999999998,162.51999999999998," I'll never forget, because she said, you know, when you're watching somebody on your screen"
162.52,169.08," and that person goes, poof, you've got to make sure that you've got everything right."
169.08,177.08, I was starting to see in the news that our mission had a very high civilian casualty rating.
177.08,184.20000000000002," She began to feel guilt while battling illness, depression, and the eating disorder, bulimia."
184.20000000000002,191.04000000000002, She left the Air Force for a top secret civilian job at the National Security Agency at Fort
191.04,194.44," Gordon in Augusta, Georgia."
194.44,201.2," But here in 2017, she says what she was hearing in English worried her far more than intercepts"
201.2,203.28, in Farsi and Pashto.
203.28,209.44," If you don't catch a hacker, okay, in the act, it's very hard to say who did the hacket."
209.44,214.56, The president was raising doubt that Russia attacked the 2016 election.
214.56,217.88, His interview with John Dickerson was typical of the time.
217.96,219.35999999999999, I'll go along with Russia.
219.35999999999999,220.12, Could have been China.
220.12,222.0, Could have been a lot of different groups.
222.0,225.32, But it was Russia and the NSA knew it.
225.32,231.56, Reality winner had seen proof in a top secret report on an in-house news feed.
231.56,239.35999999999999," I just kept thinking, my God, somebody needs to step forward and put this right."
239.35999999999999,240.72, Somebody.
240.72,250.2, The secret report said in 2016 the Russian military executed cyber espionage against 122 local
250.2,256.64, government organizations targeting officials involved in the management of voter registration
256.64,258.04, systems.
258.04,263.72, It was top secret in part because it revealed what the US knew about Russian tactics.
263.72,268.44, Winner told us she was exposing a white house cover-up.
268.44,274.28," She printed the report, dropped it in this mailbox, addressed anonymously to an online"
274.28,278.71999999999997, news source that specialized in government wrongdoing.
278.71999999999997,282.28, The NSA report was published a month later.
282.28,284.92, You knew it was stamp top secret.
284.92,286.24, You knew what that meant.
286.24,287.24, I knew that.
287.24,295.28," I knew it was secret, but I also knew that I had pledged service to the American people."
295.28,299.28, Even at that point in time it felt like they were being led astray.
299.28,303.11999999999995, Winner was caught as soon as the top secret report surfaced.
303.11999999999995,307.52, The NSA could see on its network that she printed it.
307.52,310.79999999999995, She drove home to a new reality.
310.79999999999995,314.47999999999996, A plain black sedan came up behind my car.
314.47999999999996,319.88, And two men in polo shirts came out and introduced themselves as FBI agents.
319.88,325.4," A transcript shows the FBI agents told her the interrogation was voluntary, and they"
325.4,328.56, didn't mention her right to an attorney.
328.56,334.0," Winner lied about mailing the report, then confessed and was arrested."
334.0,338.8," The government hit her with the most serious possible charge, espionage."
338.8,344.2, Bale was denied after prosecutors told a judge that Winner wrote in her diary that she
344.2,347.24, was mad enough to burn the white house.
347.24,352.16," They suggested she might defect to the Taliban, to the public."
352.16,353.48, They said this.
353.48,359.6, Winner's will for purposeful disclosure caused exceptionally grave damage to U.S. national
359.6,361.0, security.
361.0,367.36, But what prosecutors called grave damage was a bombshell of truth to the Federal Election
367.36,371.44," Assistance Commission, which helped secure the vote."
371.44,376.8, In hours the commission issued an alert on the NSA document leak.
376.8,383.2, It spelled out the top secret email addresses utilized by the attackers and urged officials
383.2,386.04, to check email logs.
386.04,393.32," Blindsided by Winner's revelation, the commission called for full disclosure of election security"
393.32,394.32, intelligence.
394.32,402.92," Two, former officials told us reality winner helped secure the 2018 midterm election."
402.92,408.4, One of the things that you learned about the espionage charge is that in court you're
408.4,413.84, not allowed to talk about what you leaked or why you leaked it.
413.84,416.96, What would you have told the judge?
416.96,427.28," That I thought this was the truth, but also did not betray our sources and methods, did"
427.28,431.79999999999995," not cause damage, did not put lives on the line."
431.79999999999995,440.15999999999997, It only filled in a question mark that was tearing our country in half in May 2017.
440.15999999999997,442.08, And that I met no harm.
442.08,444.84, But there was harm for her.
444.84,449.96," As her case dragged on 16 months, she says depression was consuming her."
449.96,454.76, Her mother moved from Texas to Augusta to be with her daughter.
454.76,465.28, There would just be times when it almost wasn't worth it to see the end of this.
465.28,469.28, And so...
469.28,473.59999999999997, You had thoughts of taking your own life.
473.59999999999997,476.11999999999995, Yes.
476.11999999999995,481.96, I started to plan my suicide and I would do practice runs.
481.96,491.08, The only thing that was stopping me was my mom because she was still in Augusta.
491.08,497.76, My dad had gone back to Texas to go to work and I just refused to let her hear that news
497.76,500.68, by herself.
500.68,505.08," So I would get on the phone and just try to talk around it and hey, there's no need"
505.08,506.4, to stick around.
506.4,508.8, Visitations not worth it.
508.8,511.15999999999997," Go back to Texas, just go."
511.15999999999997,512.3199999999999, Just go.
512.3199999999999,518.64," Her mother, Billy, heard that while sitting in on our interview with her daughter, reality"
518.64,529.1999999999999, told us that she was planning to kill herself.
529.1999999999999,531.8, I heard that.
531.8,535.04, Yeah.
535.04,537.56, Did you know she was in that much trouble?
537.56,546.48," I mean, there were some very dark days but then they would be followed by a better day."
546.48,550.6, I just knew when I was there in Georgia I couldn't leave.
550.6,553.2, I couldn't leave her.
553.2,557.76," In 2018 at the age of 26, winner pleaded guilty."
557.76,560.96, The judge said he would make an example of her.
560.96,567.84," She served four years behind bars plus three now, answering to a probation officer."
567.84,570.36, She still can't talk about the case.
570.36,577.88, I've had four years of just trying to say I'm not a terrorist.
577.88,584.8000000000001, I can't even begin to talk about my actual espionage indictment or have a sense of accomplishment
584.8000000000001,593.16, in having survived prison because I'm still stained by them accusing me of being the
593.16,599.9200000000001, same groups that I enlisted in the Air Force to fight against.
599.92,607.52, So I don't let myself feel anything regarding the actual act or the charge until I can
607.52,611.5999999999999, let it be known that I'm not what they said I was.
611.5999999999999,618.1999999999999, She served her sentence during prison lockdowns for COVID and the unrest after the police murder
618.1999999999999,620.04, of George Floyd.
620.04,627.0," In a cell with two companions, depression and bulimia, she became self-destructive."
627.0,633.96," You know, every time that I had to give in to my ownness, I put it on my body."
633.96,638.4, I cut myself everywhere.
638.4,639.48, I couldn't leave my cell.
639.48,641.48, I couldn't work out.
641.48,648.48, And all I could do was ask why and ask why and a chaplain walked by and I asked him why
648.48,650.32, they were doing this to us.
650.32,656.76," And that same chaplain that I had seen for two years looked me in my face and said,"
656.76,660.56, nobody gives a **** about chaplain here.
660.56,664.28, I started getting high that day.
664.28,666.68, Everyone knows there's drugs in prison.
666.68,675.68," I was reduced to binging and purging, getting high every day and cutting myself."
675.68,678.24, Happy been able to get clean.
678.24,680.24, I have.
680.24,686.08, I just am ashamed to say how hard it is.
686.08,690.72, It's worth noting how inconsistent the government is in these cases.
690.72,698.5600000000001," In 2008, Greg Bergerson, a Pentagon employee, was convicted of selling secrets to the Chinese."
698.5600000000001,704.4000000000001," That's him in FBI surveillance, getting his pocket stuffed with cash."
704.4000000000001,709.84, His sentence was six months shorter than reality winners.
709.84,716.88," In 2012, former Army General and CIA director David Petraeus gave notebooks of top secret"
716.88,721.2, information to an author who was his mistress.
721.2,726.96," He was charged with misdemeanor, mishandling of classified information and never spent"
726.96,729.1600000000001, a minute in jail.
729.1600000000001,731.08, Was it worth it?
731.08,739.08, I try so hard not to frame things as being worth it or not worth it.
739.08,748.6800000000001, What I know is that I'm home with my parents and we take our lives every day moving forward
748.6800000000001,755.0, as being richer in knowing what to be grateful for.
755.0,757.84," It's okay, you're here."
757.84,758.84, You're here.
758.84,763.0400000000001, Grateful for the moment of her prison release.
763.0400000000001,765.9200000000001, We said this story is complicated.
765.92,771.4799999999999," In the one hand, individuals can't be deciding what to declassify."
771.4799999999999,777.28," On the other, some things are classified to conceal wrongdoing, torture in the war on"
777.28,779.76," terror, for example."
779.76,787.0," In a home in Texas, one mother has simplified the story her way with a portrait of a veteran"
787.0,793.0799999999999, and a display of a commendation for meritorious service to her country.
793.08,795.48, What reality did was not espionage.
795.48,798.5600000000001, What reality did was patriotism.
798.5600000000001,805.0, She actually stood up and worked for the American people to give us the truth about an attack
805.0,809.64," on our vote, an attack on our democracy, an attack on our country."
809.64,818.0400000000001, I'm very proud of her for that.
818.04,823.76, How recent leaks of government documents have stirred debate over the espionage act at
