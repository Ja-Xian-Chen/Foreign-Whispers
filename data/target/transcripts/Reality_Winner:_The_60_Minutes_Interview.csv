319.8,325.08," A transcript shows the FBI agents told her the interrogation was voluntary,"

413.64,415.8, What would you have told the judge?

427.08,434.44," did not cause damage, did not put lives on the line. It only filled in a question mark"

577.8,584.76," I can't even begin to talk about my actual espionage indictment, or have a sense of accomplishment"
584.76,593.64," in having survived prison, because I'm still stained by them accusing me of being the same"
594.4399999999999,601.64, groups that I enlisted in the Air Force to fight against. So I don't let myself feel anything

644.9200000000001,652.12, and a chaplain walked by. And I asked him why they were doing this to us. And that same chaplain
652.12,658.0400000000001, that I had seen for two years looked me in my face and said nobody gives a f*** about
658.04,665.4, chaplain here. I started getting high that day. Everyone knows there's drugs in prison.
666.68,674.1999999999999," I was reduced to binging and purging, getting high every day and cutting myself."
675.4,684.04," Happy been able to get clean. I have, I just am ashamed to say how hard it is."
684.04,692.76," It's worth noting how inconsistent the government is in these cases. In 2008, Greg Bergerson,"
692.76,701.24," a Pentagon employee, was convicted of selling secrets to the Chinese. That's him in FBI surveillance,"

748.6800000000001,753.96, as being richer in knowing what to be grateful for.
758.52,765.0, Grateful for the moment of her prison release. We said this story is complicated.
765.72,770.52," On the one hand, individuals can't be deciding what to declassify."
771.32,777.72," On the other, some things are classified to conceal wrongdoing, torture in the war on terror,"
777.72,783.88," for example. In a home in Texas, one mother has simplified the story her way,"
784.68,791.88, with a portrait of a veteran and a display of a commendation for meritorious service to her country.
792.84,800.28," What reality did was not espionage, what reality did was patriotism. She actually stood up and"
800.28,807.16, worked for the American people to give us the truth about an attack on our vote and attack on
