<p t="2000" d="5600">in his first 100 days president biden focused on 
the coronavirus pandemic but over the course of  </p>
<p t="7600" d="6160">his term the biden presidency will be defined 
by how the united states competes with china  </p>
<p t="13760" d="5280">in a few years china&#39;s economy is expected 
to surpass the u.s as the world&#39;s biggest  </p>
<p t="19680" d="5600">to determine how the united states will deal with 
china&#39;s growing influence mr biden has chosen one  </p>
<p t="25280" d="6480">of his closest aides as secretary of state it 
falls to anthony blinken to rebuild a depleted  </p>
<p t="31760" d="6480">and demoralized state department repair u.s 
alliances and champion what diplomats call the  </p>
<p t="38240" d="5760">rules-based international order the written and 
unwritten code that governs how nations deal with  </p>
<p t="44000" d="8400">one another rules that he says are now threatened 
by china the story will continue in a moment</p>
<p t="55760" d="8400">it is the one country in the world that has 
the military economic diplomatic uh capacity to  </p>
<p t="64800" d="5920">undermine or challenge the rules-based order that 
we uh we care so much about and are determined  </p>
<p t="70720" d="6080">to defend but i want to be very clear about 
something and this is important our purpose is not  </p>
<p t="77520" d="7440">to contain china to hold it back to keep it 
down it is to uphold this rules-based order  </p>
<p t="86080" d="5440">that china is posing a challenge to anyone who 
poses a challenge to that order we&#39;re going to  </p>
<p t="91520" d="5840">stand up and defend it i know you say the goal is 
not to contain china but have you ever seen china  </p>
<p t="97360" d="6240">be so assertive or aggressive militarily no we 
haven&#39;t i think what we&#39;ve witnessed over the last  </p>
<p t="104800" d="8240">several years is china acting more repressively at 
home and more aggressively abroad that is a fact  </p>
<p t="113040" d="7600">what&#39;s china&#39;s goal i think that over time 
china believes that it it can be and should  </p>
<p t="120640" d="8240">be and will be the dominant country in the world 
chinese fighter jets are increasingly visible  </p>
<p t="128880" d="4800">in the skies above the western pacific 
where the u.s navy also has a presence  </p>
<p t="135520" d="6560">this past week china&#39;s president xi unveiled 
three new warships to patrol the south china sea  </p>
<p t="142080" d="6560">it already has the world&#39;s largest navy and could 
use it to invade taiwan a democratic island and  </p>
<p t="148640" d="5520">long-standing u.s ally do you think we&#39;re heading 
towards some sort of military confrontation with  </p>
<p t="154160" d="3840">china i think it&#39;s profoundly against the 
interests of both china and the united states  </p>
<p t="158640" d="4240">uh to uh to get to that point or even to 
head in that direction let&#39;s talk about human  </p>
<p t="162880" d="5200">rights describe what you see it&#39;s happening in 
xinjiang that maybe the rest of the world doesn&#39;t  </p>
<p t="168080" d="6400">we&#39;ve made clear that um we see a genocide having 
taken place against uh the uyghurs in xinjiang  </p>
<p t="175120" d="4960">more than a million people have been put 
into choose your term concentration camps  </p>
<p t="180080" d="5920">re-education camps internment camps when 
beijing says oh there&#39;s a terrorism threat  </p>
<p t="186960" d="6320">which we don&#39;t see it&#39;s not coming from a million 
people our administration six weeks ago in alaska  </p>
<p t="193280" d="6400">secretary blinken confronted young giache 
china&#39;s top diplomat about genocide in xinjiang  </p>
<p t="199680" d="5760">and china&#39;s military aggression we feel an 
obligation to raise these issues here today</p>
<p t="208880" d="6240">the exchange became an international incident 
caught on camera and not lost in translation  </p>
<p t="215120" d="5360">the united states does not have the qualification 
to say that it wants to speak to china from a  </p>
<p t="220480" d="6720">position of strength if shinzone is in a red line 
with china then what is look we don&#39;t have the  </p>
<p t="227760" d="7280">luxury of not dealing with china there are real 
complexities to the relationship whether it&#39;s the  </p>
<p t="235040" d="3920">adversarial piece whether it&#39;s the competitive 
piece whether it&#39;s the the cooperative piece  </p>
<p t="239600" d="5920">even before the meeting in alaska president 
xi had warned about the dawn of a new cold war  </p>
<p t="246080" d="4400">during president trump&#39;s time in office 
china found the u.s less predictable than  </p>
<p t="250480" d="7600">past administrations and i just announced another 
10 tariffs mr trump imposed tariffs on hundreds  </p>
<p t="258080" d="5760">of billions of dollars of chinese products in 
response to what he called unfair trade practices  </p>
<p t="263840" d="6640">and the theft of u.s intellectual property so far 
the biden administration has kept the tariffs in  </p>
<p t="270480" d="5600">place i also told president xi that we&#39;ll maintain 
a strong military presence china may be the only  </p>
<p t="276080" d="6160">big issue of the day in washington in which 
democrats and republicans find common cause  </p>
<p t="282240" d="6080">the chinese have stolen hundreds of billions 
if not trillions of dollars of trade secrets  </p>
<p t="288320" d="5440">and intellectual property from the united states 
that sounds like the actions of an enemy certainly  </p>
<p t="293760" d="5280">sounds like the actions of of someone who&#39;s 
trying to compete unfairly uh and increasingly in  </p>
<p t="299040" d="4720">adversarial ways but we&#39;re much more effective 
and stronger when we&#39;re bringing like-minded  </p>
<p t="303760" d="4800">and similarly aggrieved countries together to say 
to beijing this can&#39;t stand and it won&#39;t stand  </p>
<p t="308560" d="6800">so is that a message that president biden has 
delivered to president xi certainly in their in  </p>
<p t="315360" d="5360">their first conversation uh they covered a lot 
of ground it was a reportedly a two-hour phone  </p>
<p t="320720" d="7840">call it was yeah i was there and so did president 
biden tell president xi to cut it out president  </p>
<p t="328560" d="6640">biden made clear that in a number of areas we have 
real concerns about the actions that china has  </p>
<p t="335200" d="6400">taken and that includes in the economic area and 
that includes the theft of intellectual property  </p>
<p t="341600" d="7440">china&#39;s gross domestic product is expected 
to surpass the united states as early as 2028  </p>
<p t="350560" d="6160">well it&#39;s a large country it&#39;s got a lot of 
people if china becomes the wealthiest country  </p>
<p t="356720" d="6160">in the world doesn&#39;t that also make it the most 
powerful a lot depends on how it uses that wealth  </p>
<p t="362880" d="5840">it has an aging population it has significant 
uh environmental problems and so on but here&#39;s  </p>
<p t="368720" d="4640">the way i think about it nor writ large if we&#39;re 
talking about what really makes the wealth of a  </p>
<p t="373360" d="6400">nation fundamentally it&#39;s it&#39;s human resources and 
the ability of any one country to maximize their  </p>
<p t="379760" d="5760">potential that&#39;s the challenge uh for us it&#39;s the 
challenge for china i think we&#39;re in a much better  </p>
<p t="385520" d="6000">place to maximize that uh that human potential 
than any country on earth if we&#39;re smart about it  </p>
<p t="391520" d="6240">china thinks long-term strategically decades 
in advance is america just caught up on  </p>
<p t="397760" d="6880">the latest fires here and there and we&#39;re not 
thinking long term strategically and as a result  </p>
<p t="406080" d="4000">china will surpass us what i 
found looking at our own history  </p>
<p t="410960" d="5920">is that when we&#39;ve confronted a significant 
challenge significant competition uh significant  </p>
<p t="416880" d="4880">adversity we&#39;ve managed to come together and 
actually do the long-term thinking the long-term  </p>
<p t="421760" d="4480">investment and that is really the moment we&#39;re in 
now and that&#39;s the test that i think we&#39;re facing  </p>
<p t="427120" d="3120">are we actually going to rise to 
it president biden believes we are  </p>
<p t="431120" d="4720">anthony blinken occupies a suite of offices 
on the seventh floor of the state department  </p>
<p t="436400" d="5440">but he first worked for joe biden at the senate 
foreign relations committee nearly 20 years ago  </p>
<p t="441840" d="5760">and has barely left his side since in the obama 
white house secretary blinken held concurrent  </p>
<p t="447600" d="6160">roles as an assistant to the president and the 
national security advisor for vice president biden  </p>
<p t="453760" d="4720">it&#39;s been the most consequential professional 
relationship and and also in many ways personal  </p>
<p t="458480" d="5600">relationship uh that i&#39;ve uh that i&#39;ve had how 
often do you speak it&#39;s pretty close to daley you  </p>
<p t="464080" d="4400">speak to him every day in one way or another 
you know we&#39;re we&#39;re pretty good at meetings  </p>
<p t="469120" d="4560">so there are a few of those when i thought 
about the relationship that you have had  </p>
<p t="475040" d="4240">with with president biden over the years in 
the senate and then when he was vice president  </p>
<p t="480080" d="5360">the only relationship that i could come up with 
though i&#39;m not a historian um was of course  </p>
<p t="485440" d="5200">secretary baker and president george h.w bush 
i&#39;d be flattered by any comparison to secretary  </p>
<p t="490640" d="5200">baker i actually i spoke to him on the phone a few 
months ago and we talked about the importance of  </p>
<p t="496800" d="4240">ideally a secretary of state having a close 
relationship with uh with the president  </p>
<p t="501040" d="4080">he was extraordinarily effective for all 
sorts of reasons but that was i think a source  </p>
<p t="505840" d="5200">of his effectiveness secretary of state 
james baker helped president george h.w bush  </p>
<p t="511040" d="5600">end the cold war with the soviet union the 
current secretary is in the midst of winding  </p>
<p t="516640" d="9360">down america&#39;s longest war in afghanistan are you 
prepared for a worst case scenario in afghanistan  </p>
<p t="526720" d="5760">where the u.s backed government fails 
and the taliban takes over we have to  </p>
<p t="532480" d="4800">be prepared for every scenario and there are a 
range of them and uh we we&#39;re looking at this  </p>
<p t="538320" d="5920">uh in a very clear-eyed way but nora we&#39;ve 
been engaged in afghanistan for 20 years and  </p>
<p t="544960" d="4080">we sometimes forget why we went there in the first 
place and that was to deal with the people who  </p>
<p t="549040" d="6160">attacked us on 9 11. and we did just because our 
troops are coming home doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re leaving  </p>
<p t="555200" d="4800">we&#39;re not our embassy&#39;s staying the support that 
we&#39;re giving to afghanistan when it comes to  </p>
<p t="560560" d="7760">economic support development humanitarian that 
that remains and not only from us from partners  </p>
<p t="568320" d="6400">and allies somewhat related will the biden 
administration close guantanamo bay we believe  </p>
<p t="574720" d="4240">that it should be that&#39;s certainly a goal but 
it&#39;s something that we&#39;ll bring some focus to in  </p>
<p t="578960" d="6000">the months ahead in this past wednesday&#39;s address 
to congress president biden spoke about his plans  </p>
<p t="584960" d="5280">for immigration reform for more than 30 years 
politicians have talked about immigration reform  </p>
<p t="590880" d="6080">and we&#39;ve done nothing about it it&#39;s time to fix 
it it&#39;s a subject not usually central to the state  </p>
<p t="596960" d="4800">department&#39;s mission but we asked secretary 
blinken about it because of the refugee crisis  </p>
<p t="601760" d="6240">on america&#39;s southern border border crossings 
for undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed  </p>
<p t="608560" d="6080">in march more than a hundred and seventy thousand 
people were taken into custody that&#39;s the highest  </p>
<p t="615520" d="4560">in 20 years are the policies of 
the bidet administration to blame  </p>
<p t="620800" d="8800">no what we&#39;re seeing is indeed a surge of people 
to the border we&#39;ve seen that in the past but  </p>
<p t="629600" d="10160">we inherited a totally broken system uh broken 
intentionally and it takes time to fix it and by  </p>
<p t="639760" d="8080">the way our message is very clear don&#39;t come the 
border is not open you won&#39;t get in but we have to  </p>
<p t="647840" d="5920">understand what is motivating so many people to do 
this and it is usually desperation but that&#39;s not  </p>
<p t="653760" d="4880">new i want to talk about the policies of the biden 
administration because president biden did use his  </p>
<p t="658640" d="8000">executive authority to curb deportations to allow 
more asylum seekers to enter the united states  </p>
<p t="667280" d="7280">so are these new policies by the administration 
contributing to this surge we&#39;re focused when it  </p>
<p t="674560" d="7040">comes to people coming into making sure that that 
children unaccompanied minors are treated humanely  </p>
<p t="681600" d="7920">and according to the law is it problematic 
to tell migrants well no you can&#39;t come here  </p>
<p t="689520" d="3840">and then at the same time create a different 
situation on the ground that does allow them  </p>
<p t="694080" d="4160">to come but the point is that they&#39;re not and 
what&#39;s one of the challenges that uh that we&#39;ve  </p>
<p t="698240" d="8720">had is that um traffickers and others are trying 
to tell them that the border is open it&#39;s not but  </p>
<p t="706960" d="4160">children are being allowed in and they&#39;re being 
children are the one exception because we we will  </p>
<p t="711120" d="6240">not it is the it is the right thing to do we are 
not going to abide the notion that children are  </p>
<p t="717360" d="7040">kept in a precarious dangerous situation that is 
unacceptable blinken himself is a father of two  </p>
<p t="724400" d="6640">young children and hails from a family that only 
a few generations ago were themselves refugees his  </p>
<p t="731040" d="6800">paternal great grandfather meyer blinken emigrated 
to new york city from ukraine fleeing russian  </p>
<p t="737840" d="7120">oppression in 1904 this coming week the secretary 
of state will visit ukraine to show support for  </p>
<p t="744960" d="6960">the country currently in the throes of more recent 
russian aggression president putin has amassed a  </p>
<p t="751920" d="7360">very large force at the border with ukraine more 
than a hundred thousand troops what is putin up to</p>
<p t="761520" d="4000">you&#39;re right there are more forces massed on 
the border with ukraine than any time since  </p>
<p t="765520" d="6720">2014 when russia actually invaded i can&#39;t 
tell you that we know mr putin&#39;s intentions  </p>
<p t="772880" d="6080">there are any number of things that he could 
do or or choose not to do what we have seen in  </p>
<p t="779600" d="6480">the last few days is apparently a decision to 
pull back some of those forces and we&#39;ve seen some  </p>
<p t="786080" d="4720">of them in fact start to pull back that&#39;s been 
verified that they are pulling back starting now  </p>
<p t="791920" d="1440">we&#39;re watching that very very carefully</p>
<p t="798000" d="3440">secretary blinken on china&#39;s 
influence in hong kong  </p>
