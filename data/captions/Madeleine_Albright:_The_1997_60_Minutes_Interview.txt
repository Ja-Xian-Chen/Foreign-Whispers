<p t="1360" d="6800">60 minutes rewind madeleine albright has been 
on the job for a few weeks now and washington  </p>
<p t="8160" d="6080">is already used to the idea of addressing the 
country&#39;s top diplomat as madam secretary but  </p>
<p t="14240" d="4880">when we dropped in on the new secretary of state 
last week we found she&#39;s still getting used to  </p>
<p t="19120" d="7120">the idea do you ever pinch yourself every morning 
you know sometimes you wake up and you think well  </p>
<p t="26240" d="4960">i just had a nice dream do you think it&#39;s really 
true you know and so it&#39;s a little bit like that  </p>
<p t="32160" d="4640">somebody said to me early on do you realize 
that you have thomas jefferson&#39;s job  </p>
<p t="37680" d="9920">and that kind of a little uh oh there yeah 
yes well this entire hall is filled with  </p>
<p t="47600" d="6800">former secretaries of state and it gives you 
a great sense of history and uh i have to  </p>
<p t="54400" d="5200">and to think that i&#39;m now at the end of this 
line what do you want people to know about you  </p>
<p t="61040" d="7120">i actually i want them to know everything about 
me i am somebody who who likes to have people know  </p>
<p t="68160" d="6880">about me i am not a secretive person one thing 
about albright that is no secret is that she came  </p>
<p t="75040" d="7280">to america as a child a refugee whose family fled 
czechoslovakia twice first from the nazis then  </p>
<p t="82320" d="5360">from the communists but there were some things 
about her life that even albright didn&#39;t know  </p>
<p t="87680" d="6800">until just a few days ago with the opening up of 
czechoslovakia and with my naming as secretary  </p>
<p t="94480" d="5360">of state there has been some very compelling 
information that the washington post found  </p>
<p t="101120" d="7440">that my family was indeed of jewish origin 
and that my grandparents may in fact have  </p>
<p t="108560" d="5840">died in concentration camp and this was all 
unknown to you totally i was raised catholic  </p>
<p t="115360" d="11440">and my parents uh were very political and saw the 
story uh as one or their explanation to us was  </p>
<p t="126800" d="6560">that they left for political reasons what albright 
claims she just learned is that two and possibly  </p>
<p t="133360" d="5760">three of her grandparents were rounded up by the 
nazis and taken to auschwitz where they die at the  </p>
<p t="139120" d="6480">time albright her sister and parents were refugees 
in london her parents never told her that they  </p>
<p t="145600" d="6240">had converted to catholicism in the 30s and only 
told her that her grandparents had died in the war  </p>
<p t="152720" d="5680">this new chapter in our family history has come 
as a surprise to albright who had been very close  </p>
<p t="158400" d="6400">to her parents particularly her father joseph 
corbell a czech diplomat who was serving at the  </p>
<p t="164800" d="6880">united nations in 1948 when the communists took 
over in prague were you very serious as a as a  </p>
<p t="172720" d="6000">young girl a young woman yes i was i remember the 
war distinctly we were in london during the blitz  </p>
<p t="179280" d="5760">i remember what it was like to come out of the 
airaid shelter and see london bombed and then i  </p>
<p t="185040" d="4960">was sent to school in switzerland by myself when 
i was 10. so i was pretty serious i think i was  </p>
<p t="190000" d="7360">pretty boring in high school i was very i was a 
foreign policy wonk even then your sister says  </p>
<p t="197360" d="6800">you&#39;re a lot more fun now i think i am i think i 
am i hope to i hope i am i know that fun for you  </p>
<p t="204160" d="7680">is working hard but you have to do something to 
get away from this i have a farm not far from here  </p>
<p t="211840" d="7520">and nobody would ever recognize me on the farm 
as i uh play around in my garden barefooted and  </p>
<p t="219360" d="6880">i go to the movies and i knit but there&#39;s an 
awful lot to do you&#39;re having fun at it yes  </p>
<p t="226240" d="6000">so far so good young madeleine corbell as a new 
immigrant tried to have fun too but her father  </p>
<p t="232240" d="7600">maintained a certain old world outlook believe 
it or not my father used to follow me on dates  </p>
<p t="240640" d="8080">he would let the poor boy drive me to the dance 
follow us and then insist that we be driven home  </p>
<p t="249280" d="5200">and to this day i will never forget the 
mortification of when he&#39;s made me get into  </p>
<p t="254480" d="5040">his car while my date followed me home and then 
invited this poor boy in for milk and cookies  </p>
<p t="259520" d="6800">i didn&#39;t see that boy again and a chat with 
him that too albright says she tried to be less  </p>
<p t="266320" d="5040">protective when raising her three daughters they 
were there in the oval office last month holding  </p>
<p t="271360" d="5680">the family bible when albright was sworn in as 
secretary of state the senior cabinet member  </p>
<p t="277040" d="5920">and the country&#39;s top diplomat so help me god 
so help me god congratulations madam secretary</p>
<p t="285120" d="5200">in her new job madeleine albright is moving 
straight ahead in washington&#39;s fast lane  </p>
<p t="290320" d="4160">but she&#39;s been in the public eye for 
the last four years when she served as  </p>
<p t="294480" d="5280">ambassador to the united nations there 
she stood out from the pinstripe crowd  </p>
<p t="300400" d="3520">how many times have you seen the 
macarena at the security council</p>
<p t="306880" d="7040">you certainly weren&#39;t the typical diplomat at the 
united nations you were known for being outspoken  </p>
<p t="313920" d="6880">some even said that you were at times undiplomatic 
is is that just the way you are or was that  </p>
<p t="320800" d="6160">a deliberate tactic well first of all i truly 
do believe it&#39;s important to say what you think  </p>
<p t="327520" d="6400">and albright often did exactly that in the usually 
stuffy confines of the u.n she told off the french  </p>
<p t="333920" d="7280">the comments by the french defense minister are 
very ill informed and counterproductive she warned  </p>
<p t="341200" d="7120">saddam hussein let it be absolutely clear to the 
iraqi government that a repetition of its past  </p>
<p t="348320" d="7280">mistakes will be met by my government with the 
same resolve as before she threatened haiti&#39;s  </p>
<p t="355600" d="8320">military leaders you can depart voluntarily and 
soon or you can depart involuntarily and soon and  </p>
<p t="363920" d="6480">she used an undiplomatic spanish word to express 
her contempt for the way cuban fighter pilots  </p>
<p t="370400" d="7440">boasted about shooting down two unarmed american 
civilian planes last year frankly this is not  </p>
<p t="377840" d="6720">cojones this is cowardice her boss president 
clinton called that the best one-liner in his  </p>
<p t="384560" d="5440">administration&#39;s foreign policy and it reflected 
something else that&#39;s different about madeleine  </p>
<p t="390000" d="6560">albright she&#39;s willing her critics say too willing 
to send american troops into foreign conflicts  </p>
<p t="397120" d="7520">she backed using american military force in haiti 
in somalia in rwanda and in bosnia rather than  </p>
<p t="404640" d="7040">feeling that it is wrong to interfere i always 
believe that if you can stop something early  </p>
<p t="412320" d="6560">and you can show the support of free countries 
for those who are under totalitarianism  </p>
<p t="418880" d="4240">then it&#39;s worth doing that&#39;s my mindset there 
are a lot of people who would read that as  </p>
<p t="423680" d="7120">your willingness to put american military men 
and women in harm&#39;s way the ability of america to  </p>
<p t="430800" d="8560">marry force and diplomacy is something that is 
very important to the maintenance of our values  </p>
<p t="439360" d="6240">and i think that we have to be very very 
selective when we think about using our military  </p>
<p t="446560" d="6960">but we can&#39;t be afraid to diplomacy was not in 
her career plan in college she covered politics  </p>
<p t="453520" d="6400">for the student newspaper and wanted to become a 
journalist three days after graduation in 1959 she  </p>
<p t="459920" d="7760">married joseph albright a reporter and heir to a 
newspaper fortune but his job stood in her way one  </p>
<p t="467680" d="6720">of my husband&#39;s editors actually said to me honey 
you may want to be a reporter but you can&#39;t be on  </p>
<p t="474400" d="6320">a competing paper and you can&#39;t be on the paper 
that your husband works on so why don&#39;t you find  </p>
<p t="480720" d="5120">another career and i did and i didn&#39;t fight it 
so you could have been a journalist i could have  </p>
<p t="485840" d="4400">could have ended up covering the state department 
well i could have and i could have asked nasty  </p>
<p t="490240" d="6640">questions do you get peeved at all when people 
focus on appearance rather than substance what  </p>
<p t="496880" d="6080">is noted uh what i have on or whether i&#39;m 
going to have a facelift i think that kind of  </p>
<p t="502960" d="8000">gets me down i haven&#39;t had a facelift by 
the way the story will continue after this</p>
<p t="514240" d="7120">albright had her first children twins in 1961 
but she was determined to have a career as well  </p>
<p t="521360" d="5680">she went to graduate school and got involved 
in politics she worked on capitol hill for then  </p>
<p t="527040" d="5280">senator ed muskey and then moved to the carter 
white house as an aide to the national security  </p>
<p t="532320" d="5760">council when you went to work for senator muskie 
your first paying job you&#39;re 39 years old you must  </p>
<p t="538080" d="4880">have felt you had a lot of catching up to do did 
you have a plan i never had a plan and i&#39;ve said  </p>
<p t="542960" d="9520">this to a lot of young women is that the only plan 
i ever had was to try to use the knowledge that i  </p>
<p t="552480" d="7200">had work hard and have a good time um my version 
of good time which is which is to work hard  </p>
<p t="561360" d="5680">and make and make a difference as hokey as that 
might sound if albright&#39;s professional life had  </p>
<p t="567040" d="6320">a hokey storybook quality not so her personal 
life what would you say was the greatest setback  </p>
<p t="573360" d="8160">in your life well um a diversion from 
plan i must say was my divorce probably  </p>
<p t="582320" d="7680">in that i had not expected that and i had expected 
to continue in what i was doing and live happily  </p>
<p t="590000" d="5440">ever after you didn&#39;t see it coming i certainly 
did not know did that change you in some way  </p>
<p t="596640" d="5680">did it did you become more determined did you feel 
you had something to prove no i think it made me  </p>
<p t="602320" d="6160">more self-reliant though i think if it taught 
me anything it was to to rely on my own judgment  </p>
<p t="609760" d="7280">and to do what i needed to do for my daughters 
and for myself after the breakup of her 23-year  </p>
<p t="617040" d="5840">marriage albright got a job teaching international 
relations at georgetown university in washington  </p>
<p t="622880" d="7680">but she tried to teach the women in her classes 
something else to interrupt i found that as a  </p>
<p t="630560" d="8640">woman kind of working my way up in the government 
was that women often wait too long in meetings  </p>
<p t="639200" d="5600">to make their views known then all of a 
sudden some man says whatever it is that  </p>
<p t="644800" d="5600">you were gonna say and everybody thinks it&#39;s 
brilliant so i basically taught people never  </p>
<p t="650400" d="9440">to raise their hands and interrupt and i 
think that that&#39;s what women need to do</p>
<p t="660640" d="80">you</p>
