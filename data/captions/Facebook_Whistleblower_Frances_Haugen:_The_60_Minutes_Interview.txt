<p t="1680" d="7680">her name is francis haugen that is a fact that 
facebook has been anxious to know since last month  </p>
<p t="9360" d="6720">when an anonymous former employee filed complaints 
with federal law enforcement the complaints say  </p>
<p t="16080" d="7360">facebook&#39;s own research shows that it amplifies 
hate misinformation and political unrest but the  </p>
<p t="23440" d="7040">company hides what it knows one complaint alleges 
that facebook&#39;s instagram harms teenage girls  </p>
<p t="31200" d="7040">what makes haugen&#39;s complaints unprecedented is 
the trove of private facebook research she took  </p>
<p t="38240" d="6880">when she quit in may the documents appeared first 
last month in the wall street journal but tonight  </p>
<p t="45120" d="6960">frances haugen is revealing her identity to 
explain why she became the facebook whistleblower  </p>
<p t="53760" d="4080">the story will continue in a moment</p>
<p t="59280" d="5280">the thing i saw at facebook over and over again 
was there were conflicts of interest between what  </p>
<p t="64560" d="5760">was good for the public and what was good for 
facebook and facebook over and over again chose  </p>
<p t="70320" d="6640">to optimize for its own interests like making more 
money francis haugen is 37 a data scientist from  </p>
<p t="76960" d="7840">iowa with a degree in computer engineering and a 
harvard master&#39;s degree in business for 15 years  </p>
<p t="84800" d="6000">she&#39;s worked for companies including google and 
pinterest i&#39;ve seen a bunch of social networks  </p>
<p t="90800" d="3920">and it was substantially worse at facebook than 
anything i&#39;d seen before you know someone else  </p>
<p t="94720" d="6560">might have just quit and moved on and i wonder why 
you take this stand imagine you know what&#39;s going  </p>
<p t="101280" d="4720">on inside facebook and you know no one on the 
outside knows i knew what my future looked like  </p>
<p t="106000" d="5840">if i continued to stay inside of facebook which is 
person after person after person has tackled this  </p>
<p t="111840" d="5840">inside of facebook and ground themselves to the 
ground when and how did it occur to you to take  </p>
<p t="117680" d="6160">all of these documents out of the company at some 
point in 2021 i realized okay i&#39;m going to have  </p>
<p t="123840" d="5760">to do this in a systemic way and i have to get out 
enough that no one can question that this is real  </p>
<p t="130960" d="5760">she secretly copied tens of thousands 
of pages of facebook internal research  </p>
<p t="137440" d="6240">she says evidence shows that the company is lying 
to the public about making significant progress  </p>
<p t="143680" d="8880">against hate violence and misinformation one study 
she found from this year says we estimate that we  </p>
<p t="152560" d="6960">may action as little as three to five percent 
of hate and about six tenths of one percent of  </p>
<p t="159520" d="6160">violence and incitement on facebook despite 
being the best in the world at it to quote  </p>
<p t="165680" d="6640">from another one of the documents you brought 
out we have evidence from a variety of sources  </p>
<p t="172320" d="6720">that hate speech divisive political speech and 
misinformation on facebook and the family of apps  </p>
<p t="179600" d="6880">are affecting societies around the world when 
we live in an information environment that is  </p>
<p t="186480" d="7440">full of angry hateful polarizing content it erodes 
our civic trust it erodes our faith in each other  </p>
<p t="193920" d="5840">it erodes our ability to want to care for each 
other the version of facebook that exists today  </p>
<p t="200720" d="3600">is tearing our societies apart and 
causing ethnic violence around the world  </p>
<p t="205040" d="7440">ethnic violence including myanmar in 2018 when 
the military used facebook to launch a genocide  </p>
<p t="213200" d="6960">the first quarter of 2019. francis haugen told 
us she was recruited by facebook in 2019 she  </p>
<p t="220160" d="6960">says she agreed to take the job only if she could 
work against misinformation because she had lost  </p>
<p t="227120" d="6160">a friend to online conspiracy theories i never 
wanted anyone to feel the pain that i had felt  </p>
<p t="233840" d="5600">and i had seen how high the stakes were in terms 
of making sure there was high quality information  </p>
<p t="239440" d="6320">on facebook at headquarters she was assigned 
to civic integrity which worked on risks to  </p>
<p t="245760" d="5760">elections including misinformation but after 
this past election there was a turning point  </p>
<p t="252320" d="5920">they told us we&#39;re dissolving civic integrity 
like they basically said oh good we made it  </p>
<p t="258240" d="4720">through the election there wasn&#39;t riots we can get 
rid of civic integrity now fast forward a couple  </p>
<p t="262960" d="6000">months we got the insurrection and when they got 
rid of civic integrity it was the moment where  </p>
<p t="268960" d="7440">i was like i don&#39;t trust that they&#39;re willing to 
actually invest what needs to be invested to keep  </p>
<p t="276400" d="6480">facebook from being dangerous facebook says 
the work of civic integrity was distributed to  </p>
<p t="282880" d="9360">other units haugen told us the root of facebook&#39;s 
problem is in a change that it made in 2018 to its  </p>
<p t="292240" d="5200">algorithms the programming that decides 
what you see on your facebook news feed  </p>
<p t="298000" d="6240">so you know you have your phone you might see 
only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll  </p>
<p t="304240" d="4800">off for you know five minutes but facebook 
has thousands of options it could show you  </p>
<p t="309600" d="6800">the algorithm picks from those options based on 
the kind of content you&#39;ve engaged with the most  </p>
<p t="316400" d="5840">in the past and one of the consequences of how 
facebook is picking out that content today is it  </p>
<p t="322240" d="6080">is optimizing for content that gets engagement 
or reaction but its own research is showing  </p>
<p t="328880" d="6560">that content that is hateful that is divisive that 
is polarizing it&#39;s easier to inspire people to  </p>
<p t="335440" d="8080">anger than it is to other emotions misinformation 
angry content is enticing to people and keeps  </p>
<p t="343520" d="7360">them on the platform yes facebook has realized 
that if they change the algorithm to be safer  </p>
<p t="351440" d="5440">people will spend less time on the site they&#39;ll 
click on less ads they&#39;ll make less money haugen  </p>
<p t="356880" d="7040">says facebook understood the danger to the 2020 
election so it turned on safety systems to reduce  </p>
<p t="365840" d="4800">but many of those changes she says were 
temporary and as soon as the election was  </p>
<p t="370640" d="3440">over they turned them back off or they changed 
the settings back to what they were before  </p>
<p t="374800" d="5040">to prioritize growth over safety and that 
really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me  </p>
<p t="380480" d="7600">facebook says some of the safety systems remained 
but after the election facebook was used by some  </p>
<p t="388080" d="6960">to organize the january sixth insurrection 
prosecutors cite facebook posts as evidence  </p>
<p t="395600" d="7520">photos of armed partisans and texts including 
by bullet or ballot restoration of the republic  </p>
<p t="403120" d="8320">is coming extremists used many platforms but 
facebook is a recurring theme after the attack  </p>
<p t="411440" d="7440">facebook employees raged on an internal message 
board copied by haugen haven&#39;t we had enough  </p>
<p t="418880" d="7040">time to figure out how to manage discourse without 
enabling violence we looked for positive comments  </p>
<p t="425920" d="7680">and found this i don&#39;t think our leadership 
team ignores data ignores dissent ignores truth  </p>
<p t="434400" d="7200">but that drew this reply welcome to facebook 
i see you just joined in november 2020  </p>
<p t="442160" d="4960">we have been watching wishy-washy actions 
of company leadership for years now  </p>
<p t="447840" d="5360">colleagues cannot conscience working for a 
company that does not do more to mitigate  </p>
<p t="453200" d="7040">the negative effects of its platform facebook 
essentially amplifies the worst of human nature  </p>
<p t="461120" d="4960">it&#39;s one of these unfortunate consequences 
right no one at facebook is malevolent but  </p>
<p t="466080" d="5600">the incentives are misaligned right like facebook 
makes more money when you consume more content  </p>
<p t="472320" d="6240">people enjoy engaging with things that elicit an 
emotional reaction and the more anger that they  </p>
<p t="478560" d="6000">get exposed to the more they interact and more 
they consume that dynamic led to a complaint to  </p>
<p t="484560" d="7280">facebook by major political parties across europe 
this 2019 internal report obtained by haugen  </p>
<p t="492400" d="6480">says that the parties feel strongly that the 
change to the algorithm has forced them to skew  </p>
<p t="498880" d="7440">negative in their communications on facebook 
leading them into more extreme policy positions  </p>
<p t="506320" d="4320">the european political parties were essentially 
saying to facebook the way you&#39;ve written  </p>
<p t="510640" d="7520">your algorithm is changing the way we lead our 
countries yes you are forcing us to take positions  </p>
<p t="518160" d="5600">that we don&#39;t like that we know are bad for 
society we know if we don&#39;t take those positions  </p>
<p t="524400" d="8240">we won&#39;t win in the marketplace of social media 
evidence of harm she says extends to facebook&#39;s  </p>
<p t="532640" d="7120">instagram app one of the facebook internal studies 
that you found talks about how instagram harms  </p>
<p t="539760" d="7600">teenage girls oh yeah one study says 13 and a 
half percent of teen girls say instagram makes  </p>
<p t="547360" d="9520">thoughts of suicide worse 17 of teen girls say 
instagram makes eating disorders worse and what&#39;s  </p>
<p t="556880" d="7200">super tragic is facebook&#39;s own research says as 
these young women begin to consume this eating  </p>
<p t="564080" d="4800">disorder content they get more and more depressed 
and it actually makes them use the app more  </p>
<p t="570240" d="4560">and so they end up in this feedback cycle 
where they hate their bodies more and more  </p>
<p t="574800" d="5360">facebook&#39;s own research says it is not 
just that instagram is dangerous for  </p>
<p t="580160" d="6320">teenagers that it harms teenagers it&#39;s that it is 
distinctly worse than other forms of social media  </p>
<p t="587120" d="7280">facebook said just last week it would postpone 
plans to create an instagram for younger children  </p>
<p t="595600" d="4960">last month haugen&#39;s lawyers filed at least 
eight complaints with the securities and  </p>
<p t="600560" d="6240">exchange commission which enforces the law in 
financial markets the complaints compare the  </p>
<p t="606800" d="7920">internal research with the company&#39;s public face 
often that of ceo mark zuckerberg here testifying  </p>
<p t="614720" d="6080">remotely to congress last march we removed content 
that could lead to imminent real world harm  </p>
<p t="620800" d="5600">we&#39;ve built an unprecedented third-party 
fact-checking program the system isn&#39;t perfect but  </p>
<p t="626400" d="5440">it&#39;s the best approach that we&#39;ve found to address 
misinformation in line with our country&#39;s values  </p>
<p t="632560" d="6640">one of francis haugen&#39;s lawyers is john tai he&#39;s 
the founder of a washington legal group called  </p>
<p t="639200" d="8000">whistleblower aid what is the legal theory behind 
going to the sec what laws are you alleging have  </p>
<p t="647200" d="8560">been broken as a publicly traded company facebook 
is required to not lie to its investors or even  </p>
<p t="655760" d="6400">withhold material information so the 
sec regularly brings enforcement actions  </p>
<p t="662160" d="5600">alleging that companies like facebook and others 
are making material misstatements and omissions  </p>
<p t="668320" d="6400">that affect investors adversely one of the things 
that facebook might allege is that she stole  </p>
<p t="674720" d="6640">company documents the dodd-frank act passed 
over 10 years ago at this point created uh  </p>
<p t="681360" d="6320">an office of the whistleblower inside the sec and 
one of the provisions of that law says that no  </p>
<p t="687680" d="6160">company can prohibit its employees from 
from communicating with the sec and sharing  </p>
<p t="693840" d="4480">internal corporate documents with the 
sec i have a lot of empathy for mark  </p>
<p t="698320" d="6880">and mark has never set out to make a hateful 
platform but he has allowed choices to be made  </p>
<p t="705920" d="4960">where the side effects of those choices are that 
hateful polarizing content gets more distribution  </p>
<p t="710880" d="6240">more reach facebook declined an interview but 
in a written statement to 60 minutes it said  </p>
<p t="718000" d="5120">every day our teams have to balance protecting 
the right of billions of people to express  </p>
<p t="723120" d="6560">themselves openly with the need to keep our 
platform a safe and positive place we continue  </p>
<p t="729680" d="5040">to make significant improvements to tackle the 
spread of misinformation and harmful content  </p>
<p t="735440" d="8800">to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing 
is just not true if any research had identified an  </p>
<p t="744240" d="6480">exact solution to these complex challenges 
the tech industry governments and society  </p>
<p t="750720" d="8080">would have solved them a long time ago facebook 
is a one trillion dollar company just 17 years  </p>
<p t="758800" d="10080">old it has 2.8 billion users which is 60 percent 
of all internet connected people on earth francis  </p>
<p t="768880" d="7200">haugen plans to testify before congress this week 
she believes the federal government should impose  </p>
<p t="776080" d="6160">regulations facebook has demonstrated they cannot 
act independently facebook over and over again has  </p>
<p t="782240" d="6640">shown it uses profit over safety it is subsidizing 
is paying for its profits with our safety  </p>
<p t="788880" d="4160">i&#39;m hoping that this will have had a big 
enough impact on the world that they get  </p>
<p t="793040" d="7120">the fortitude and the motivation to actually go 
put those regulations into place that&#39;s my hope</p>
<p t="804960" d="3120">more from the facebook whistleblower publishers  </p>
